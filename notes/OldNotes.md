  * check documentation in code to understand how it was solved
  * VVVVIIIIPPPPPPPPP, should resolve it for practice


- [Create Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/description/)
  * Did it in 2 ways:
    1. DP: it a bit difficult cz its ganna be a 3d [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/discuss/77314/O(m*n*k)-DP-solution-TLE)
      * Let f(i,j,k) represent maximum number of length k generated from nums1[1:i] and nums2[1:j].       
      *  the formula is: f(i,j,k) = max{f(i-1,j,k), f(i,j-1,k), f(i-1,j,k-1) + [nums1[i]], f(i,j-1,k-1) + [nums2[j]] }
    2. Greedy:
      * To find the maximum ,we can enumerate how digits we should get from nums1 , we suppose it is i.
        => So , the digits from nums2 is K - i.
      * And we can use a stack to get the get maximum number(x digits) from one array.
      * OK, Once we choose two maximum subarray , we should combine it to the answer.
        => It is just like merger sort,
        -  __but we should pay attention to the case: the two digital are equal.__
          => we should find the digits behind it to judge which digital we should choose now.
          => In other words,we should judge which subarry is bigger than the other.     
## BST

### Hints 

- Most of the time Pre,In,Post orders problems are duality to each other you have to just find the right duality
- Always practice Pre,In,Post in iterative and Morris Algo
- Try to use TreeSet or TreeMap

- [Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/description/)
  * VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP problem
  * __Practice this problem more__
  *  __Needs REVIEW__ : Was able to solve it due to previous question but better
  * its the duality of problem Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
  * Explanation:
    * This question is the DUALITY of {@link ConstructBinaryTreefromPreorderandInorderTraversal#buildTree(int[], int[])}:
      *    1- instead of starting from index zero and incrementing in both lists (preOrder, inOrder) we start from the last index and decrement in both lists (postOrder, inOrder)
      *    2- In the code we reverse the logic which means where we call current.left become current.right and current.right becomes current.left
    * Why?
      * since a preOrder algo is: current, left, right
      * while a postOrder algo is: left, right, current
      * So...
        *  1- we do point 1 since the current used to be the first and now its the last
        *  2- we do point 2 since the order was (current and then left) now its in reverse order we have (current and then right)
    *  If you draw the tree for the post and in order arrays as follows:
      *  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9, 7, 1
      *  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
      *  you will realize that the above statements are visually true

- [Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/255_verify_preordersequence_in_binary_search_tree.html)
  * VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP problem
  * the trick here is to use the Iterative preOrder algo to solve it
  * at first did it with an additional stack   * optimized it to use O(1) space
  * check my code in intellij
  * my solution can be refactored to become like [their solution](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/255_verify_preordersequence_in_binary_search_tree.html)


- [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/)
  * Pay attention that the **condition holds if we are on a leaf node and the sum == 0** and not when reaching a null node 
  * since: 
    * if we have only a null node as a root we shouldnt return anything
    * if we may added the list twice (when reaching right child of leaf null and left child where both are null)

- [Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)
  - check note in order note.md in cummulative section

- [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/discuss/)
  * looks like your outputting the order in a preOrder traversal
  * Did it in a recursive way (check my solution)
  * __VERY NICE SOLUTION__ others did it in an iterative way with O(1) space


- [Binary Tree Upside Down](http://bangbingsyb.blogspot.com/2014/11/leetcode-binary-tree-upside-down.html)
  * this question is locked in LeetCode
  * basically we do the recurse only to the left and after recursion we flip the pointer as said in the question
  * so root.left.left = root.right and root.left.left = root
  * check [geek of geek](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flip-binary-tree/)
  * the left most node will never have a right child since the question says
  "all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty"


- [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/136796845/)
  * time complexity is O((logn)^2) => T(N) = T(N/2) + O(logn)
  * the O(logn) at every level is cz of checking the height of every level + check if the left subtree of every level is complete to know to which child to recurse to
  * the T(N/2) is cz we are doing like Binary Search Algo we only traverse to 1 child either left or right
  * we check if the left sub tree is complete we add the number of node in it [= 2^(leftSubTreeHeight + 1 ) - 1 (leftSubTreeHeight = currentHeight - 1)] to the total number and then we traverse to the right child
  * if the left sub tree is not complete we add number of nodes in the right sub tree which is [= 2^(rightSubTreeHeight + 1 ) - 1 (rightSubTreeHeight = currentHeight - 1)]

- [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/solution/)
  * use Post order traversal

- [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description/)
  * VVVVIIPPPPP
  * If only once use iterative inorder traversal to find the kth smallest O(n)
  * if you do it more often augment the TreeNodes to have the size of their subtree (augmenting BST trees in algo book)

- [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)
  * check course 1 lecture 6 hw
  * [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/discuss/)

- [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/)
  * difference btw Binary Tree and BST is that the numbers are not order
  * So do InOrder traversal to find the nodes
  * check code
  * [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/18566/my-java-solution-which-is-easy-to-understand)

- [Count Univalue Subtrees](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/250_count_univalue_subtrees.html)
  * do a Post Order traversal
  * the return value should of the recursive function is boolean to indicate if the current subtree is a univalue one
  * A node is a univalue subtree if its children are and if its equal to the value of its children => the parent is a univalue
  * solution check my code

- [Closest Binary Search Tree Value II](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/09/leetcode-closest-binary-search-tree_8.html)
  * At first we would find the place that the {@code target} would be. since we dont have pointers to parent from children => we use a stack {@code parents} to save the parent nodes
  * To find the closest {@code k} nodes to the {@code target} we try to do an algo like merge sort at every time we try to find the successor of a node and the predecessor of another node the one that has a less
 diff with the target will be added to {@code result}.
  * So at first we start by fetching the successor and predecessor of the {@code target} and then we fetch the successor of the successor or the predecessor of the predecessor and so on...  until we reach {@code k} nodes
  * if its a BST => space complexity O(log n) and time complexity O(k + log n) since finding predecessor and successor consecutively is amortized O(1)
  * [a solution like mine](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/23151/o-logn-java-solution-with-two-stacks-following-hint/9) its a comment written by (ofLucas)
  * other people used the stacks to save all nodes that are less to the target in the pred and all nodes greater than target in suc [other solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/22940/ac-clean-java-solution-using-two-stacks) 

- [Inorder Successor in BST](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-inorder-successor-in-bst-java/)
  * this can be solved in time: O(log n) and space: O(1)
  * no need for stack to save the parents   * just save the best solution while trying to fetch for the node that you currently on



- [Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-consecutive-sequence-binary-tree/)
  * do a preOrderTraversal
  * __TRICK:__ to decide the length at every node do: return Math.max(leftLength, rightLength, __currentLength__).
    -  we need to compare to currentLength since the children may reset the length since child.val != current.val + 1
  * [my solution](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/12/blog-post.html)

- [Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/description/)
  * I did it based on normal preorder recusion
  * a nicer solution was proposed using: counting the (outdegrees of a nodes - indegrees of a node) at the end it should be = 0
    - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/78551/7-lines-Easy-Java-Solution)

- [Largest BST Subtree](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/07/leetcode-largest-bst-subtree-java/)
  * its a simple Post Order traversal but for every node we return 3 values:
    1. size of subtree
    2. min of subtree
    3. max of subtree
  * [solution](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/07/leetcode-largest-bst-subtree-java/)

- [Sum of Left Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/description/)
  - Here they need to only sum the __left Leaves__
  - left means the leaf is a left child

### Augmenting BST
 
- [Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/description/)
  * similar to above __Longest Increasing Subsequence__ problem using the __BST solution__
  * instead of saving the max increasing subseq at every node we save the size of the subtree => upon inserting a node we can add the number of nodes less than the current
  * in order to get the correct answer we must start iterating from the end of the array an insert every element upon iteration to retrieve the count of this element
  * This problem uses the same Data Structure for the __ranking problem__

- [Russian Doll Envelopes](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/description/)
  * This problem is a DP problem:
    1- sort the problem by __Asc width and Desc height__;
      - WHY???         
      in order to cut the time from O(n^2) to O(n logn) I should fetch all the envelopes that are greater than the current envelop =>
        sort => this means the values in the dp are only the envelopes greater than the current
    2- find a data structure to store the number of envelopes that its stored in
      - we can use an augmented BST => key of node is H and value is the number of envelops that is inside
      - we can benefit from  __Longest Increasing Subsequence__ since we only care about the total number of envelopes inside each other => its the same problem as LIS
  * time: O(n logn), space: O(n) 

- [Count of Range Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/description/)
  * This problem uses the same Data Structure for the __ranking problem__
  * augment the BST by the size of the subtree



## Pointers / Linked List


### Tips

- Try to use DummyHead if the head will change its place
- Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection): Think of using Slow and Fast pointers 
- Runner technique: use more than one pointers separated btw each other with a constant distance (cracking coding interview p93)
- If end -> beginning (reverse order) __ex: Plus One Linked List__ => 2 ways:
  1. recursive
  2. reverse order + compute + reverse order again
- when re-arranging nodes make sure to change node.next to appropraite value or null
  - ex: **Odd Even Linked List**

- [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)
  * VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  * __Needs REVIEW__
  *  __Practice this problem more__   
  * i did it using BST (O(nlogn)):
  * u do BST on the indecies     
  * then for every mid you calculate the number of values in nums < mid and the summation of values in nums btw start and mid
  * then depending on the 2 calculations (count and summation) you choose whether to go to the right or left
  * using the count only is not sufficient due to this scenario {2,5,4,3,3} => we also need summation     
  * check my code
  * the best solution (O(n)) is done using [__Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Cycle__](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/solution/)

- [Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/discuss/)
    * did it in a recursive
    * check my code its a gd solution
    * pay attention for corner cases:       
      - if the last value has also a carry => add one more node with 1 as value
    * use dummyHead

- [Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/description/)
  - did it iterative way since its a string => start from end of string and go to beginning
  - used StringBuilder
  
- [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/solution/)
  * My solution :     
  1. get the min lenght of two lists
    1. start both lists from this length away from the end of list
    2. then start iterating over both lists => the point they intersect is the intersection way
  * Their solution: looks like __Linked List Cycle II__ problem [check it out](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/solution/)

- [Plus One Linked List](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/08/leetcode-plus-one-linked-list-java/)
  * 2 solutions:
    1. recursive
    2. reverse order + do addition + reverse again

## Arrays

### Tips

  - If you have a linked list and you want to get the midpoint (binray search) to use it for algo in and total cost should be O(n)
   => at first start with left of midpoint then do midpoint then continue with right of midpoint check [Question](#List_To_BST)   - if your looping in a cycle somehow => could be translated to __Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Cycle__ VVVVVIIIIPPPPPPP
  - use Map to save states
  - if you want O(log n) => think something similar to Binary Search Algo
  - try to use cummulative sums and find a way to answer ur problem
  - if u need __randomization + we have very large input__ => use __*Reservoir Sampling*__

- [Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/description/)
  * I used a List to store the ListNode and then randomize to pick
  * but What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?
    * then now we use [reservoir sampling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reservoir-sampling/)
    * time: O(n)/operation
    * Algo:
      1. Create an array reservoir[0..k-1] and copy first k items of stream[] to it.
      2. Now one by one consider all items from (k+1)th item to nth item.
        - Generate a random number from 0 to i where i is index of current item in stream[]. Let the generated random number is j.
        - If j is in range 0 to k-1, replace reservoir[j] with arr[i]
      3. In our case k = 1

- [Random Pick Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/description/)
    * since array is too large => use reservoir sampling where k = 1;
    * use count of how many occurance of current value as upper bound
    * use rnd.nextInt(++count) == 0 to decide whether to take the current index or not

    ```` java
      public int pick(int target) {
          int result = -1;
          int count = 0;

## Design

- [Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/discuss/)
  * As you may know, there are 2 main approaches for this design:
    1. The first has some distributed complexity in all the operations and an O(1) getNewsFeed.
    2. The second is the O(1) for all operations and most of the complexity is the getNewsFeed.
  * __Which is better and why?__ I beleive that this is not an algorithmic/design problem this is a UX problem. Regardless of the actual complexities. Let's say that we have 2 users the first has 1M followers (people following him/her), let's call this user celebrity and the second user is following 1M other users and let's call this user normal.
    * __Design 1 => The O(1) getNewsFeed.__ While both of the users will have a very fast and nice getNewsFeed experience let's think about posting a tweet. 
      * The celerity will have a bad experience whenever he is posting a tweet and that's because he/she has a lot of followers and his new tweet will need somehow to be published to all the news feeds of the 1M followers.
      * The normal user will post a tweet in almost no time because he has very few or no followers.
    * __Design 2 => The Complex getNewsFeed.__ This time both of the users will enjoy a fantastic O(1) post tweet, but then when it comes to getting the news feed.
      * The celebrity will is following few others and aggregating his/her news feed won't take long.
      * Although the normal user who is following 1M users will need sometime to aggregate his very complex news feed.

  * Now, if you took a closer look at the previous comparison you will find that the user who has taken explicit actions to follow lots and lots of people is making his/her feed complex, he/she unfollows people it becomse simpler. Although the celebrity who is not following a lot is getting better experience because he/she has not taken explicit actions to make other people follow him.

  * In other words, the first design is somehow punishing the celebrities for getting more and more followers while the second design is punishing the users who follow a lot of people.

## Bit Manipulation

### Hints
  - use ^
  - use int[32] to store infor about every bit like in the singleNumberII
  - use Integer.lowestOneBit(n) (check documentaion in General Info)
  - n & (n - 1) to check if power of 2
  - sometimse you can use constants like __0x55555555__ to check something (check Power of Four problem)
  - check [summary](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/discuss/84278/A-summary:-how-to-use-bit-manipulation-to-solve-problems-easily-and-efficiently)
  - instead of doing (1<<i & n) try to do (n>>i & 1)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1677957/why-byte-b-byte-0xff-is-equals-to-integer-1
  - to change from decimal to Base B take adv of "int number in java is actually represented in binary" (ex: check __Convert a Number to Hexadecimal problem__)

### Problems

- [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/)
  * check this [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/discuss/54950)

- [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/discuss/)
 * did it using Integer.bitCount(n);
 * another way is to do: n & (n - 1)   
    - since if n = 4 (100) => n - 1 = 3 (11) => n & (n - 1) = 0

#### Using Constants

- [Power of Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/discuss/80456/O(1)-one-line-solution-without-loops)
  * VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  * __Needs REVIEW__
  * __Practice this problem more__
  * 2 ways:
    1.  return Integer.bitCount(num) == 1&&  Integer.numberOfTrailingZeros(num) % 2 == 0;
    2. return (num > 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0) && ((num & 0x55555555) == num);
      - The basic idea is from power of 2, We can use “n&(n-1) == 0” to determine if n is power of 2.
      - For power of 4, the additional restriction is that in binary form, the only “1” should always located at the odd position.           
      - For example, 4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 100, 4^2 = 10000.           
      - So we can use “num & 0x55555555==num” to check if “1” is located at the odd position.
  * __second solution is better cz it doesn't depend on a specific language__

- [Pairwise Swap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-all-odd-and-even-bits/)

    2. even bits
  * question: Can we take a number n and move the odd bits over by 1?

- [Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/description/)
  * can use the general solution with a mod 2
  * but since its only mod 2 => i used ^
  * [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/discuss/69006/)
  * [explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/discuss/68901/):
    * The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.
        * One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, we actually get the XOR of the two target numbers (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results in 0). Consider the XOR result of the two target numbers; if some bit of the XOR result is 1, it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.
        * Let’s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.
        * Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i.     the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.     the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.
        * Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.
        * by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number.
    by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number

          -  transform number to Hexa manually
          -  take care of negative numbers 
      -  bitwise:
          -  The basic idea is to deal with 4 bits at a time by extracting those after ANDing with 0xf (00...1111). 
          -  Once you deal with those 4 bits, just shift by 4 bits so that you could deal with next 4. 
          -  NOTE: The good thing about the bitwise is that you don't need to worry about doing anything special with negative numbers.

    ```` java
    public String toHex(int n) {
        if ( n == 0) {
            return "0";

# General Information

## Difference between ASCII, extended ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16
  - ASCII and Unicode are two character encodings.
  - ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127. It can fit in a single 8-bit byte (needs 7 bits)
  - Extended ASCII code takes use of the last bit in the byte for other chars (so extends to 0-255)
  - Unicode uses a variable bit encoding program where you can choose between 32, 16, 8-bit encoding -> larger number of chars are supported
  - Unicode currently contains most written languages and still has room for even more.
  - In order to maintain compatibility with the older ASCII, which was already in widespread use at the time, Unicode was designed in such a way that the first eight bits matched that of the most popular ASCII page
  - Unicode is standardized while ASCII isn’t.
  - UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format.
  - UTF was developed so that users have a standardized means of encoding the characters with the minimal amount of space
  - UTF-8 and UTF 16 are only two of the established standards for encoding.
  - They only differ in how many bytes they use to encode each character
  - Since both are variable width encoding, they can use up to four bytes to encode the data but when it comes to the minimum, UTF-8 only uses 1 byte (8bits) and UTF-16 uses 2 bytes(16bits).
  - This bears a huge impact on the resulting size of the encoded files

## Diff btw segmant Tree, Range Tree, Interval Tree:
  * [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17466218/what-are-the-differences-between-segment-trees-interval-trees-binary-indexed-t)
  * __Segment tree:__ stores intervals, and optimized for "which of these intervals contains a given point" queries.
  * __Interval tree:__ stores intervals as well, but optimized for "which of these intervals overlap with a given interval" queries. It can also be used for point queries - similar to segment tree.
  * __Range tree:__ stores points, and optimized for "which points fall within a given interval" queries.   * __Binary indexed tree:__ stores items-count per index, and optimized for "how many items are there between index m and n" queries.

## How many ways to traverse a BST. We have 3 ways:
  - Recursive: O(n) time, O(n) space
  - Iterative + Stack: O(n) time, O(n) space
  - Morris Traversal: O(n) time, O(1) space 

### Morris Traversal in BST
  - O(n) time, O(1) space complexity
  - changes the state of a tree but when finished it return it back
  - the Predecessor of a sub tree will point to the root of the sub tree
  - [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGXB9OWhPTg)
  - [in order traversal](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/)

## Trie Tree
<a id ="trie">Trie Tree</a>
  - its similar to a [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)
  - its used for:
    * Auto completion
    * spelling checker
    * T9 predictive text
  - check in the Data structure section for the problems related to it
  - There are several other data structures, like balanced trees and hash tables, which give us the possibility to search for a word in a dataset of strings.Then why do we need trie? Although hash table has O(1)O(1) time complexity for looking for a key, it is not efficient in the following operations:

    * __Finding all keys with a common prefix__
    * __Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicoical order__
    * __Another reason why trie outperforms hash table, is that as hash table increases in size, there are lots of hash collisions and the search time complexity could deteriorate to O(n) WHILE TRIE is only O(m) where m is the key length__

## Caching

  - [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)
  - LRU (least recently used)
  - LFU (least frequently used)


## Boyer-Moore Majority Algorithm
  - <a id="Boyer_Moore">[Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm)</a>
  - runs in O(n) time and O(1) space
  - majority element must be > n/2
  - we can be also searching for elements > n/k => check general [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/24202/a-general-solution-for-searching-elements-that-appear-more-n-k-times)
    * number of counter equals number of possible candidate     * if one candidate hits a value equals another candidate we dont decrement the counter of the first candidate
