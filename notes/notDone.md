- [Create Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/description/)
  * Did it in 2 ways:
    1. DP: it a bit difficult cz its ganna be a 3d [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/discuss/77314/O(m*n*k)-DP-solution-TLE)
      * Let f(i,j,k) represent maximum number of length k generated from nums1[1:i] and nums2[1:j].       
      *  the formula is: f(i,j,k) = max{f(i-1,j,k), f(i,j-1,k), f(i-1,j,k-1) + [nums1[i]], f(i,j-1,k-1) + [nums2[j]] }
    2. Greedy:
      * To find the maximum ,we can enumerate how digits we should get from nums1 , we suppose it is i.
        => So , the digits from nums2 is K - i.
      * And we can use a stack to get the get maximum number(x digits) from one array.
      * OK, Once we choose two maximum subarray , we should combine it to the answer.
        => It is just like merger sort,
        -  __but we should pay attention to the case: the two digital are equal.__
          => we should find the digits behind it to judge which digital we should choose now.
          => In other words,we should judge which subarry is bigger than the other.

- [Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/description/)
  * VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP problem
  * __Practice this problem more__
  *  __Needs REVIEW__ : Was able to solve it due to previous question but better
  * its the duality of problem Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
  * Explanation:
    * This question is the DUALITY of {@link ConstructBinaryTreefromPreorderandInorderTraversal
      *    1- instead of starting from index zero and incrementing in both lists (preOrder, inOrder) we start from the last index and decrement in both lists (postOrder, inOrder)
      *    2- In the code we reverse the logic which means where we call current.left become current.right and current.right becomes current.left
    * Why?
      * since a preOrder algo is: current, left, right
      * while a postOrder algo is: left, right, current
      * So...
        *  1- we do point 1 since the current used to be the first and now its the last
        *  2- we do point 2 since the order was (current and then left) now its in reverse order we have (current and then right)
    *  If you draw the tree for the post and in order arrays as follows:
      *  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9, 7, 1
      *  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
      *  you will realize that the above statements are visually true

- [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/discuss/)
  * looks like your outputting the order in a preOrder traversal
  * Did it in a recursive way (check my solution)
  * __VERY NICE SOLUTION__ others did it in an iterative way with O(1) space


- [Binary Tree Upside Down](http://bangbingsyb.blogspot.com/2014/11/leetcode-binary-tree-upside-down.html)
  * this question is locked in LeetCode
  * basically we do the recurse only to the left and after recursion we flip the pointer as said in the question
  * so root.left.left = root.right and root.left.left = root
  * check [geek of geek](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flip-binary-tree/)
  * the left most node will never have a right child since the question says
  "all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty"



- [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/136796845/)
  * time complexity is O((logn)^2) => T(N) = T(N/2) + O(logn)
  * the O(logn) at every level is cz of checking the height of every level + check if the left subtree of every level is complete to know to which child to recurse to
  * the T(N/2) is cz we are doing like Binary Search Algo we only traverse to 1 child either left or right
  * we check if the left sub tree is complete we add the number of node in it [= 2^(leftSubTreeHeight + 1 ) - 1 (leftSubTreeHeight = currentHeight - 1)] to the total number and then we traverse to the right child
  * if the left sub tree is not complete we add number of nodes in the right sub tree which is [= 2^(rightSubTreeHeight + 1 ) - 1 (rightSubTreeHeight = currentHeight - 1)]

- [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/solution/)

- [Count Univalue Subtrees](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/250_count_univalue_subtrees.html)
  * do a Post Order traversal
  * the return value should of the recursive function is boolean to indicate if the current subtree is a univalue one
  * A node is a univalue subtree if its children are and if its equal to the value of its children => the parent is a univalue
  * solution check my code

- [Closest Binary Search Tree Value II](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/09/leetcode-closest-binary-search-tree_8.html)
  * At first we would find the place that the {@code target} would be. since we dont have pointers to parent from children => we use a stack {@code parents} to save the parent nodes
  * To find the closest {@code k} nodes to the {@code target} we try to do an algo like merge sort at every time we try to find the successor of a node and the predecessor of another node the one that has a less
 diff with the target will be added to {@code result}.
  * So at first we start by fetching the successor and predecessor of the {@code target} and then we fetch the successor of the successor or the predecessor of the predecessor and so on...  until we reach {@code k} nodes
  * if its a BST => space complexity O(log n) and time complexity O(k + log n) since finding predecessor and successor consecutively is amortized O(1)
  * [a solution like mine](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/23151/o-logn-java-solution-with-two-stacks-following-hint/9) its a comment written by (ofLucas)
  * other people used the stacks to save all nodes that are less to the target in the pred and all nodes greater than target in suc [other solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/22940/ac-clean-java-solution-using-two-stacks) 

- [Inorder Successor in BST](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-inorder-successor-in-bst-java/)
  * this can be solved in time: O(log n) and space: O(1)
  * no need for stack to save the parents   * just save the best solution while trying to fetch for the node that you currently on

- [Russian Doll Envelopes](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/description/)
  * This problem is a DP problem:
    1- sort the problem by __Asc width and Desc height__;
      - WHY???         
      in order to cut the time from O(n^2) to O(n logn) I should fetch all the envelopes that are greater than the current envelop =>
        sort => this means the values in the dp are only the envelopes greater than the current
    2- find a data structure to store the number of envelopes that its stored in
      - we can use an augmented BST => key of node is H and value is the number of envelops that is inside
      - we can benefit from  __Longest Increasing Subsequence__ since we only care about the total number of envelopes inside each other => its the same problem as LIS
  * time: O(n logn), space: O(n)

- if asked to find the next permutation => use **Trie**



**_Hints_**

- **if u want to return combinations**
  - save the values in a temp Collection
  - => use a temp arrayList or set or queue
  - but at the **base case copy all values** to the new array that ur ganna save (ex: **result.add(new ArrayList<>(container))**;)
  
- if u **dont want repetition or the same value in different place or u need to preserve order**
  - **use starting index** where every recursive call will start from this index and upwards
  - => **doesn't look at behind values**
  - ex: for(int **index = startingIndex**; index < nums.length; ++index)

- if we have **duplicates** => **sort the array** at first
  - and skip duplicate values if needed

- **check oneNote on how to solve these kinds of questions**

**_Problems_**


- [Factor Combinations](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/254_factor_combinations.html)
  - did it in DFS
    - pass the multiplier as a start point to decompose the multiplicent so that the decomposed factors are >=  multiplier
      - => preserve the asc order in the resulting array
    - at every result u get even if its a subproblem add it to the result 
      - (we cant wait until we reach the end)
  - I did it using DP
  - can do it like previous problems using DFS (using the general solution)
 

- [Expression Add Operators](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/description/)
  - did it using backtracking general solution
  - did a double backtracking to have a clearer solution
    1.  one for the numbers only
    2.  the other for the signs
  - used the algo of **BASIC CALCULATOR II**
  - check solution with [one-combined DFS](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/discuss/71895/Java-Standard-Backtrace-AC-Solutoin-short-and-clear)

- [Word Squares](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2016/10/leetcode-425-word-squares.html)
  - used backtracking to get all combinations
  - trie to find the prefix in the previous words

**_Hints_**

- **check oneNote on how to solve these kinds of questions**

**_Problems_**

- [Word Pattern II](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/07/leetcode-word-pattern-ii-java/)

  - time complexity O(n ^ n)
  - use **Word Pattern** problem
  - use a bit from [Justifying para DP problem](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/124226772/)

- [Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-invalid-parentheses/)

  - do a normal DFS
  - time O(n)
  - at every index we recurs twice if current char is '(' or ')':
    1.  with this current char
    2.  without the current char
  - we can optimize it more but i didnt do it

- [Android Unlock Patterns](http://www.learn4master.com/interview-questions/leetcode/leetcode-android-unlock-patterns)

  - this problem asks only for the count of the different combinations and not to output the combinations and still we do backtracking

- [Generalized Abbreviation](https://gist.github.com/cangoal/bb57a4879a3c892566028b74f1ce50ec)

  - did it in a backtracking way
  - [solution](https://gist.github.com/cangoal/bb57a4879a3c892566028b74f1ce50ec)
  - similar to solution 3 in the above link

- [Minimum Unique Word Abbreviation](http://shirleyisnotageek.blogspot.com/2016/10/minimum-unique-word-abbreviation.html)

  - This is a combination of [Valid Word Abbreviation](http://shirleyisnotageek.blogspot.com/2016/10/valid-word-abbreviation.html) and [Generalized Abbreviation](https://gist.github.com/cangoal/bb57a4879a3c892566028b74f1ce50ec)
  - did it in a backtracking way
  - 2 steps to solve:
    1. generate Abbreviations of the word
       - generate them in a **smart way** so that u dont generate all of the abbs
       - **If we find the smallest valid Abb we return** => no need to check rest of Abb
    2. For every Abb generated we check if its valid within the Dict
       - if yes => Disregard it and find the next Abb

- [Additive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/description/)
  - Do back tracking
  - if int is so large => keep them as String and do addition on the fly

* [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/description/)

  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPP problem
  - Solved it in two ways: (check both functions in code)
    1.  solved it in a full DP approach O($k\*I^2$)
    2.  but then i optimized it to O($K\*I$) VVVIIIIPPPPPPP method:
        1.  by saving the state of max profit upon buying a current stock on specific day.
        2.  This specific day should be < current day since the current day is the day to sell this bought stock
        3.  NOTE: buying a current stock at a specific day means that the previous stock should be sold if I bought a previous stock before
  - Equivalence with **Knapsack** => the Sac Size here is the number of transactions and the items here are the prices every day
  - did it in general for K transactions, it looks like Knapsack and stock hw problem
  - [explanation of my solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/4766/a-clean-dp-solution-which-generalizes-to-k-transactions)


* [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/)

  - in this question we dont have a limit on Transactions => no need for second dimension of length K like previous problems
    => only 1 is needed over the prices of every day
  - The problem here is the cool down => we need to keep the max profit after sell up till before yesterday so that we can calculate **maxProfitAfterBuy = max(profitAfterBuy, profitPreviousSell - price[i])**
    => we need to limit current maxProfitPreviousSell to max (i - 2) position
    => we always check max(maxProfitPreviousSell, profitAfterSellOfBeforeYesterday) => max(maxProfitPreviousSell, dp[i - 2])
  - we only need a dp[] to save the profitOfSell on everyday => space complexity O(n)
    - we can optimize the space complexity to O(1) by saving:
      1.  maxProfitPreviousSell (this is max profit after sell up till before yesterday)
      2.  profitMinus2 (profit Of Yesterday)
      3.  profitMinus1 (profit of Current)
  - check my code
  - most optimized algo:
    - time: O(N)
    - space: O(1)

- [Edit distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

  - DP problem which is similar to wildcard matching and Regular Expression Matching problems

- [One Edit Distance](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-given-strings-are-at-edit-distance-one/)

  - simpler version of Edit Distance which only takes O(n + m) time

- [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)

  - <a id="Maximum_Product_Subarray">Maximum Product Subarray</a>
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - Find a way to do it in O(n) (DP)
  - for O(n) it differs from the of Max Sum Subarray by at every current value we calculate the Min and Max current value **ex: MaxCurrentValue = Math.max(nums[index], Math.max(maxProduct - nums[index], minProduct - nums[index]))** and the same for MinCurrentValue
  - It can be done using Divide and Conquer O(n lgn)
  - for D&C its a bit different from that of Max Sum Subarray by also keeping track of min on Left and min on Right to multiply them by each other and check if their product is the max

- [Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/description/)

  - VVVVVIIIIIIPPPPPPPP problemm
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - can use the solution of [Longest Palindromic Substring]
  - the modification is whenever you have a palindrome (even if its not the largest one) check the necessary on cntds on it!!!!!
  - It was so hard to solve it despite the solution was easy



- [Integer Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/description/)

  - solve it using recursive + memorization
  - **note use long instead of int for corner cases**

  ```java
   if(num % 2 == 0)
        return dp[num] = 1 + solve(num/2);
    else
      return dp[num] = 1 + min(solve(num+1), solve(num-1));
  ```



- [Bomb Enemy](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2016/06/leetcode-361-bomb-enemy.html)

  - easy to do it in brute force
  - but we can do it in time: O(mn) and space O(n) where m = rows and n = columns
  - check the solution in the link or check my solution
  - the brute force method is doing the same stuff many times so if we use a dp we can get the info needed of the current cell from the previous cell






- [Paint Fence](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-pain-fence-java/)

  - looks like the [House Robber problem](
  - use traversal DP to solve this
  - O(n)
  - not necessary to use array[n] its sufficient to use only to variable (paintLikePrevious, dontPaintLikePrevious) => space: O(1)


- [Nim Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/description/)
  - looks like **alternating coin game lecture 10 course 2**
  - somehow we have to find dp[n] = max(min(...), min(....))
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/discuss/134338/Formal-way-of-dynamic-programming-(DP))



- [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/)

  - its a typical DP problem
  - It would be slow to to save all the String combinations while doing the DP instead for starting index save the possible ending indices
  - and then after finishing the DP do a DFS starting from index 0
  - solution like what i did [check solution 2](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/03/leetcode-word-break-ii-java/)

- [Different Ways to Add Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - NOTE: looks like the Matrix Multiplication DP problem in course
  - can do it recursively and iter dp
  - time O(2^n) since we are outputting all the combinations and not the max
  - I thought i can do it like the the [general solution in the permutation] but it seems it cant be solved cz its hard to remove duplicate solutions
  - [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/26076/java-recursive-9ms-and-dp-4ms-solution)

- [Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/description/)

  - The difference btw scrambling and permutation is that in scrambling a subtree for the first word should have the same letters (diff order) as a subtree in the second word
  - looking at the example they gave, subtree "eat" and "tae" have the same letters but scrambled since subtree "at" and "ta" are scramble and "e" == "e" => these subtrees are scrambled with respect to each other
  - The important thing is that the sibling of the leaf nodes are the same in both trees (ex: "a" and "t" are sibling in "at" subtree and "t" and "a" are sibling in "ta") and ("e" and "at" are sibling in "eat" and "ta" and "e" are sibling in "tae" => "eat" and "tea" are scramble with respect to each other)
  - **_note: in order to know if two substrings are scramble They should have the same LENGTH_** => THATS WHY WE HAVE A LOOP OVER LENGTH
  - This problem looks like **Parenthesis DP Problem** (from inside to outside)
  - could be done in O(n^3) using DP and recursion.
  - check discussion to see the idea behind in for more info if you needed

  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - this problem is **substring DP x[i:j]** just like the Parenthesis dp problem course 1 lec21
  - the **trick** in this problem is: Instead of divide the problem by the first balloon to burst, we divide the problem by the last balloon to burst.

**_Hints_**

- use Greedy when **optimization problem** with **unity weight**
- check _Greedy_ and _Greedy vs DP sections_ in OneNote



- **Interval Scheduling**

  - check course 2 lecture 1
  - check Greedy section oneNote
  - sort by finishing time
  - Approach
    - use first finishing time rule to select interval i
    - reject all intervals that overlap selected i
    - repeat until we finish

- [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)
  - same solution as the interval scheduling idea
  - sort by finish time
  - instead of removing the overlapping now we have to count them

    - [check how Hash Function is done](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-3-rabin-karp-algorithm/)
    - in the hash function we dont care about the length of the hash value cz its always mod p (p is prime)
    - check recitation of lecture 9 course 1
    - append(val) = (u*a + val) mod p = (u mod p) * a + val mod p
    - skip(val) = (u - val _ (a^(|u| - 1) mod p) mod p = ((u mod p) - val _ (a^(|u| - 1) mod p)) mod p

- [Word Search II](

- [Word Squares](

- [Minimum Genetic Mutation](
  - use the trie even do we have diff char
  - => if we reach a diff char loop over all children in current TrieNode



- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/

  - its a dependency problem and we must find a cycle
  - so we can do it using topolical sort or DFS if at a certain point the adj vertex is grey => we have a cycle
  - pay attention when they say **to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]** => the is directed

- [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/)
  - we must output the courses in the needed order => TOPOLOGICAL SORT

- [Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/description/)

  - its similar to **alien language problem**
  - make every String in the equations a vertex => the numerators and denominators arte vertices
  - the edges btw the vertices are weighted => weight btw 2 vertices X and Y = to X/Y
  - => to calculate the division btw X/Y we should do a DFS or BFS from X to Y
  - **NOTE: I DONT CARE WHAT GRAPH ALGO I USE CZ THE DIVISION WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME => SAME TO USE DFS OR DIJKASTRA**

- [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/)

  - Pay attention that the **condition holds if we are on a leaf node and the sum == 0** and not when reaching a null node
  - since:
    - if we have only a null node as a root we shouldnt return anything
    - if we may added the list twice (when reaching right child of leaf null and left child where both are null)

- <a id="Find_Right_Interval"></a>[Find Right Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/description/)
  - since they want the first starting interval j of interval
    => used the trick (sorting + finding right interalv) of **weighted interval scheduling**
  - used the idea of indirect sorting (RTDB uses it) where we sort the indices of original array
    - use customized Comparator
  - [solution](<https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/discuss/162162/Indirect-sorting-(use-indices-to-sort)-+-customized-Comparator>)
  - Approach:
    - sort intervals based on starting point
    - traverse sorted intervals from n-1 -> 0
    - at every interval at index t binary search the sorted array from t -> n -1
      - in order to find the needed starting pint

**_Hints_**

- create an array to **store the cumulative sum at every index**

**_Problems_**

  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - could solve in using DP => O(KN)
  - but i did it by only one pass:
    - upon looping save the cummulative sum of every index in a Map, The key of map should be the sum and the value is the index
    - if we have encountered the same sum twice => save only the first index
    - upon every index try to find diff = currentCummulaticeSum - k if it exists. If yes fint the length of the subarray that sums to k
    - I used ideas from **Range Sum Query - Immutable**
  - time: O(n) space: O(n)

  - **Practice this problem more**
  - this problem is a combination of several problem
  - time: O(columns^2 _ rows _ log(rows))
  - space: O(rows)
  - approch:
    1. transform the 2D array to 1D. How?
    - get all combinations between the consecutive columns => time: O(columns^2)
      - ex: assum we have 3 columns for 1 (1->1, 1->2, 1->3), for 2: (2->2, 2->3), for 3: (3->3)
    1. for every 1D array use **Range Sum Query - Immutable** algo to solve the problem
    - but here we need currentCum - lowerCum <= k
    - => so we can use a TreeSet => lowerCum = treeset.ceiling(currentCum - k)
    1. use maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentCum - lowerCum)

- [Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)
  <a id="Path_Sum_III"></a>
  - use a map to store the cummulative sum
  - and every time find if we have a countOfDiff = map.get(currentSum - sum)
  - if we find => add countOfDiff to the count

**_Hints_**

- pay attention for overflows (ex: **Guess Number Higher or Lower**)
- try to find a pattern
  - a way so that current state can be represented in previous state, ex(Rotate Function problem): **F(k) - F(k - 1) = .....**
- if we have **'(' or ')'** think about calling **method recursively**

**_Problems_**



- [Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/description/)
  - check oneNote -> Math part
  - lets start with finding a Prim it takes O(radical n)

- [Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/discuss/)
  * As you may know, there are 2 main approaches for this design:
    1. The first has some distributed complexity in all the operations and an O(1) getNewsFeed.
    2. The second is the O(1) for all operations and most of the complexity is the getNewsFeed.
  * __Which is better and why?__ I beleive that this is not an algorithmic/design problem this is a UX problem. Regardless of the actual complexities. Let's say that we have 2 users the first has 1M followers (people following him/her), let's call this user celebrity and the second user is following 1M other users and let's call this user normal.
    * __Design 1 => The O(1) getNewsFeed.__ While both of the users will have a very fast and nice getNewsFeed experience let's think about posting a tweet. 
      * The celerity will have a bad experience whenever he is posting a tweet and that's because he/she has a lot of followers and his new tweet will need somehow to be published to all the news feeds of the 1M followers.
      * The normal user will post a tweet in almost no time because he has very few or no followers.
    * __Design 2 => The Complex getNewsFeed.__ This time both of the users will enjoy a fantastic O(1) post tweet, but then when it comes to getting the news feed.
      * The celebrity will is following few others and aggregating his/her news feed won't take long.
      * Although the normal user who is following 1M users will need sometime to aggregate his very complex news feed.

  * Now, if you took a closer look at the previous comparison you will find that the user who has taken explicit actions to follow lots and lots of people is making his/her feed complex, he/she unfollows people it becomse simpler. Although the celebrity who is not following a lot is getting better experience because he/she has not taken explicit actions to make other people follow him.

  * In other words, the first design is somehow punishing the celebrities for getting more and more followers while the second design is punishing the users who follow a lot of people.

  * [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/discuss/69006/)
  * [explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/discuss/68901/):
    * The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.
        * One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, we actually get the XOR of the two target numbers (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results in 0). Consider the XOR result of the two target numbers; if some bit of the XOR result is 1, it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.
        * Let’s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.
        * Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i.     the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.     the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.
        * Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.
        * by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number.
    by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number

  - ASCII and Unicode are two character encodings.
  - ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127. It can fit in a single 8-bit byte (needs 7 bits)
  - Extended ASCII code takes use of the last bit in the byte for other chars (so extends to 0-255)
  - Unicode uses a variable bit encoding program where you can choose between 32, 16, 8-bit encoding -> larger number of chars are supported
  - Unicode currently contains most written languages and still has room for even more.
  - In order to maintain compatibility with the older ASCII, which was already in widespread use at the time, Unicode was designed in such a way that the first eight bits matched that of the most popular ASCII page
  - Unicode is standardized while ASCII isn’t.
  - UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format.
  - UTF was developed so that users have a standardized means of encoding the characters with the minimal amount of space
  - UTF-8 and UTF 16 are only two of the established standards for encoding.
  - They only differ in how many bytes they use to encode each character
  - Since both are variable width encoding, they can use up to four bytes to encode the data but when it comes to the minimum, UTF-8 only uses 1 byte (8bits) and UTF-16 uses 2 bytes(16bits).
  - This bears a huge impact on the resulting size of the encoded files
  - check how to print the symbols in JAVA (System.out.printf("\73"); here it takes the octal rep of the symbol)

 - Normalization is a tech to normalize a data to multiple tables to reduce data redundancy  - Issues faced due to redundancy
    1. Insertion Anomaly
    2. Updating Anomaly
    3. Deletion Anomaly
 - [normalization in DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)
    - [1NF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form): A table is in 1NF <=>
      1. There's no top-to-bottom ordering to the rows.       2. There's no left-to-right ordering to the columns.
      3. There are no duplicate rows (rows should be uniquely identified).
      4. Every row-and-column intersection contains exactly one value from the applicable domain (and nothing else) (meaning not an array).
      5. All columns are regular [i.e. rows have no hidden components such as row IDs, object IDs, or hidden timestamps].
            - [2NF](https://www.1keydata.com/database-normalization/second-normal-form-2nf.php)
      1. Should Be in 1NF
      2. All attributes(non-key columns) in a row should depend on the key.       3. All non-key attributes cannot be dependent on a subset of the primary key (if composite key).
    - [3NF](https://www.1keydata.com/database-normalization/third-normal-form-3nf.php)
      1. Should Be in 2NF
      2. All columns can be determined ONLY by the KEY in the table and no other column
      3. There is no transitive functional dependency (check example in link)
    - [4NF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form)
      1. Should Be in 3NF
      1. No multi-valued Dependency
    - [BCNF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19749913/what-is-the-difference-between-3nf-and-bcnf)
      1. Should Be in 3NF
      2. for each functional dependency X ⟶ A in R, X is a key or superkey in R

  * __Segment tree:__ stores intervals, and optimized for "which of these intervals contains a given point" queries.
  * __Interval tree:__ stores intervals as well, but optimized for "which of these intervals overlap with a given interval" queries. It can also be used for point queries - similar to segment tree.
  * __Range tree:__ stores points, and optimized for "which points fall within a given interval" queries.   * __Binary indexed tree:__ stores items-count per index, and optimized for "how many items are there between index m and n" queries.

<a id ="trie">Trie Tree</a>
  - its similar to a [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)
  - its used for:
    * Auto completion
    * spelling checker
    * T9 predictive text
  - check in the Data structure section for the problems related to it
  - There are several other data structures, like balanced trees and hash tables, which give us the possibility to search for a word in a dataset of strings.Then why do we need trie? Although hash table has O(1)O(1) time complexity for looking for a key, it is not efficient in the following operations:

    * __Finding all keys with a common prefix__
    * __Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicoical order__
    * __Another reason why trie outperforms hash table, is that as hash table increases in size, there are lots of hash collisions and the search time complexity could deteriorate to O(n) WHILE TRIE is only O(m) where m is the key length__
