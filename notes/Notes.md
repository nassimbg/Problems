# Amortization

- When you want to do an operation in O(1) but u know it's hard to get it => think amortization
- check oneNote

## Remove unwanted Previous O(1) (using Linked List)

**_Hints_**

- this can be done using a **stack/LinkedList**

**_Problems_**

### Next Greater / Max O(1)

- [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/)

  - desinged it using one stack and an array to keep track of the min value
  - this question is similar to the HW problem of **Min Queue** but the hw was harder since it depends on **_Amortization_**

- [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
  - Use **Amortized Max Queue** to save get the next greater value in nums 2 and for each value in nums2 save its corresponding next greater value in a map
  - then iterate over nums1 and search the corresponding value in the saved map
  - time: O(n)
  
- [Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/description/)
  - here they are asking about the Next Greater which means the __first elemnt to the right that is greater than the value at index i__
  - uses the same concept of **Max Queue**
  - but here we have to do 2 passes the same way and leaving the same stack since we are dealing with a circular array

- [Next Greater Node In Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/)
   - here they are asking about the Next Greater which means the __first elemnt to the right that is greater than the value at index i__
  - uses the same concept of **Max Queue** starting from the right => reverse the LinkedList
  - 

### Remove Smaller/Bigger elements O(1)

- [Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/description/)

  - its a greedy algorithim
  - start from left to right
    - every char we encounter check in the stack (tail of linked list) if we have chars > current char
      - if yes remove them as long as k > 0

- [Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - This problem use a small idea from the **_Min Stack_ DS problem** which is:

    - when u insert you check:

      1. if the inserted char is smaller than the head of the stack
      2. if the char in the head of stack exists in the string after the inserted char (to garanty that the head will be present in the result)

      - if yes => pop head from stack
      - if no => push the current char

    - above cnd is in a while()

  - Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
  - Explanation:
    First, given "bcabc", the solution should be "abc". If we think about this problem intuitively, you would sort of go from the beginning of the string and start removing one if there is still the same character left and a smaller character is after it. Given "bcabc", when you see a 'b', keep it and continue with the search, then keep the following 'c', then we see an 'a'. Now we get a chance to get a smaller lexi order, you can check if after 'a', there is still 'b' and 'c' or not. We indeed have them and "abc" will be our result.

        Come to the implementation, we need some data structure to store the previous characters 'b' and 'c', and we need to compare the current character with previous saved ones, and if there are multiple same characters, we prefer left ones. This calls for a stack.

        After we decided to use stack, the implementation becomes clearer. From the intuition, we know that we need to know if there are still remaining characters left or not. So we need to iterate the array and save how many each characters are there. A visited array is also required since we want unique character in the solution. The line while(!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > c && count[stack.peek()-'a'] > 0) checks that the queued character should be removed or not, like the 'b' and 'c' in the previous example. After removing the previous characters,push in the new char and mark the visited array.

  - [check explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/solution/)
  - How I solved the problem:
    - In the given it shows that all the values in the array are distinct since array contains values from 0 -> N-1
    - When u notice the above then u can notice that the only duplication u could reach is when u jump from one value to another until u reach the value where u started ur jump
    - Then u can save everytime u reached to an index a flag it as visited
      - =>  __VIP Note:__ **u dont need to revisit this index again. Why?**
        - cz this already visited index if u start the jump from it u will reach the same length when u initially visited it since it would be a cycle
    - => time: O(n)

- [Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/)
  - time O(n)
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/solution/)
  - Algo:
    - The idea behind this method is that the correct position of the minimum element in the unsorted subarray helps to determine the required left boundary. Similarly, the correct position of the maximum element in the unsorted subarray helps to determine the required right boundary.

    - Thus, firstly we need to determine when the correctly sorted array goes wrong. We keep a track of this by observing rising slope starting from the beginning of the array. Whenever the slope falls, we know that the unsorted array has surely started. Thus, now we determine the minimum element found till the end of the array numsnums, given by minmin.

    - Similarly, we scan the array numsnums in the reverse order and when the slope becomes rising instead of falling, we start looking for the maximum element till we reach the beginning of the array, given by maxmax.

    - Then, we traverse over numsnums and determine the correct position of minmin and maxmax by comparing these elements with the other array elements. e.g. To determine the correct position of minmin, we know the initial portion of numsnums is already sorted. Thus, we need to find the first element which is just larger than minmin. Similarly, for maxmax's position, we need to find the first element which is just smaller than maxmax searching in numsnums backwards.

- [Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/)
  - Time: O(N), Space: O(N)
  - Explain
  
        - Intuition

          Instead of checking whether all(L <= R for L in left for R in right), let's check whether max(left) <= min(right).

        - Algorithm

          Let's try to find max(left) for subarrays left = A[:1], left = A[:2], left = A[:3], ... etc. Specifically, maxleft[i] will be the maximum of subarray A[:i]. They are related to each other: max(A[:4]) = max(max(A[:3]), A[3]), so maxleft[4] = max(maxleft[3], A[3]).

          Similarly, min(right) for every possible right can be found in linear time.

          After we have a way to query max(left) and min(right) quickly, the solution is straightforward.
  
```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionDisjoint(int[] A) {
        int N = A.length;
        int[] maxleft = new int[N];
        int[] minright = new int[N];

        int m = A[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            m = Math.max(m, A[i]);
            maxleft[i] = m;
        }

        m = A[N-1];

## Random Questions

- [Sentence Screen Fitting](http://shirleyisnotageek.blogspot.com/2016/10/sentence-screen-fitting.html)
  - some [solutions](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2016/10/leetcode-418-sentence-screen-fitting.html)
  - 2 ways:
    1. A naive approach is to go through the screen and put each word in it. Whenever we find a word doesn't fit to the left cells, we switch to the next line.
    2. approach:
      - We first concatenate all strings together and add spaces between words. (This string is the actual length we need to fit the string)
      - Now we have a pos variable that initializes to 0, this is the position in the All string. 
      - Now for each row, we add cols to pos, this is the position in the All string that we can fit in the row. 
      - If the pos in the All string is pointing to a white space, we know we have just fitted (at least partial) strings in it. pos increment by 1. 
      - If its a letter, we know its in the middle of the word, so we need to decrease the pos to the start of the word.
      
        ```` java
          public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
              String all = "";
              for (String s : sentence) {
                  all += s + " ";
              }
              int pos = 0;
              int len = all.length();
              for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
                  pos += cols;
                  if (all.charAt(pos % len) == ' ') {
                      pos++;
                  } else {
                      while (pos > 0 && all.charAt((pos - 1) % len) != ' ') {
                          pos--;
                      }
                  }
              }
              return pos / len;
          }
        ```` 


- [Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)
  - simple iteration over the 2D array and we need to just check if we reached an X
    - if this X has a previous X:
      - => if arry[row][col] = X and (arry[row - 1][col] || arry[row][col - 1]  ) = X 
      - => dont add number of ships

# Bit Manipulation

**_Hints_**

- oneNote

**_Problems_**

- [UTF-8 Validation](https://leetcode.com/problems/utf-8-validation/description/)
  - just check how many number of bytes we have from the first byte using {{0,0}, {2, 6}, {3, 14}, {4,30}}
  - the problem is simple:
    - from first byte we know how many bytes it follows
    - check the following byte if they start with 10xxxx
    - repeat until we reach end of data array

## use bits as states

- [Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/)

  - in order to solve it in-place we need to depend on the bits of every int in the array:
    [2nd bit, 1st bit] = [next state, current state]

    - 00 dead (next) <- dead (current)
    - 01 dead (next) <- live (current)
    - 10 live (next) <- dead (current)
    - 11 live (next) <- live (current)

  - check [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/discuss/73223/Easiest-JAVA-solution-with-explanation)
  - for the infinite board part we need only to take as input the list of Live Coordinates no need for the full board => [infinite board solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/discuss/73217/Infinite-board-solution)


---

## Bit Range Masking

- [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/submissions/)
  - in order to flip the bits we can XOR the range of bits we want to flip with a Range of all 1s => num ^ mask
  - Generating the mask to know which bits we can flip:
    - ex: 5 = 101 => we need to flip these 3 bits and not all 32 bits in int
    1. get position of highest 1 bit using Integer.highestOneBit(num)
    2. then generate the mask = int mask = (highestOneBit << 1) - 1;
    3. in order to flip the bits we can XOR the range of bits we want to flip with a Range of all 1s => num ^ mask

# Boyer-Moore Algo

- [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)
  - Read about [Boyer-Moore Algo](#Boyer_Moore)
  - runs in O(n) time and O(1) space
  - majority element must be > n/2
  - VVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

* [Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/description/)
  - its the generic form of Boyer-Moore algo
  - in this case they asked for: all number that are greater > n/3 => we have at most 2 numbers
  - Algo: we need two pointer one for each majority
  - VVVIIIPPP NOTE: while iterating if candidate1 passes by an index that has value of candidate2 we don't decrement the counter of candidate1 we only increments candidate2's counter

# Cumulative Sum

## Immutable

**_Hints_**

- create an array to **store the cumulative sum at every index**

**_Problems_**

- [Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/description/)

  - nice problem
  - create an intermidiate int[][] dp to save in it the sum of the square btw the current point and (0,0)
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/solution/)
  - i did the last solution

- [Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/10/leetcode-maximum-size-subarray-sum-equals-k-java/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - could solve in using DP => O(KN)
  - but i did it by only one pass:
    - upon looping save the cummulative sum of every index in a Map, The key of map should be the sum and the value is the index
    - if we have encountered the same sum twice => save only the first index
    - upon every index try to find diff = currentCummulaticeSum - k if it exists. If yes fint the length of the subarray that sums to k
    - I used ideas from **Range Sum Query - Immutable**
  - time: O(n) space: O(n)

- [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)
  - same as **Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k**
  - Asked by **Talabat**

- [Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - this problem is a combination of several problem
  - time: O(columns^2 _ rows _ log(rows))
  - space: O(rows)
  - approch:
    1. transform the 2D array to 1D. How?
    - get all combinations between the consecutive columns => time: O(columns^2)
      - ex: assum we have 3 columns for 1 (1->1, 1->2, 1->3), for 2: (2->2, 2->3), for 3: (3->3)
    1. for every 1D array use **Range Sum Query - Immutable** algo to solve the problem
    - but here we need currentCum - lowerCum <= k
    - => so we can use a TreeSet => lowerCum = treeset.ceiling(currentCum - k)
    1. use maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentCum - lowerCum)

- [Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)
  <a id="Path_Sum_III"></a>
  - use a map to store the cummulative sum
  - and every time find if we have a countOfDiff = map.get(currentSum - sum)
  - if we find => add countOfDiff to the count

- [Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)
  - you need to get the max cummulative sum between index i and i-k
  - my solution can be optimized by just saving the cummulative sum of 2 values i and i-k

## Cache

- [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/discuss/)
  * can do it in a very simple way using LinkedHashTable (check the code I did)
  * to do it in a [proper way](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/6613/java-hashtable-double-linked-list-with-a-touch-of-pseudo-nodes):
    1. use normal Hash table to store the key as the key and as a value store a pointer     
    2. this pointer points to the representing object of the key in the doubly linked list which is used to sort the LRU objects

- [LFU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/discuss/)
  * used a HashMap to store the key to its place in a List
  * used a List to store the Map<Key, Value> based on the key's frequency meaning that the first index in the list show all the key-value pair that have freq of 1 and second index means freq of 2 etc... (Like Bucket Sort)
  * my solution is similar to [this](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/69402/c-list-with-hashmap-with-explanation)

# DP

**_Hints_**

- **DP OR BackTracking:**

  - **output all possible options** => do **backTracking** algo
  - **get only one value** its better to try to find it using DP whether by **Iterative** or **recurssive + memo**
    - this one value may be **count all possible combinations**
  - **matrix and you want a to get an optimal value**:
    - try using **backTracking + memo => DP** algo
      => no need to spend time thinking about iterative way if it takes time to get the algo
      (ex: [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/description/))

- DP:

  1.  Iterative
  2.  recursive + memo

- Ways to approach DP:

  1.  suffix: x[i:n]
  2.  prefix: x[0:i]
  3.  substring x[i:j]

- 5 Steps:
  1. Subproblems
     - $\#subproblems$
  2. Guess
     - $\#choices$
  3. recurrence
     - Time/Subproblem
  4. Order
     - $Total Time = \#subproblems \* Time/Subproblem$
  5. Origin problem

## **_1. [Back-Tracking](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/46161/a-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-java-subsets-permutations-combination-sum-palindrome-partitioning)_**

- if asked to find the next permutation => use **Trie**
- **check oneNote on how to solve these kinds of questions**

### Output All Combinations/Permutations

**_Hints_**

- **if u want to return combinations**

  - save the values in a temp Collection
  - => use a temp arrayList or set or queue
  - but at the **base case copy all values** to the new array that ur ganna save (ex: **result.add(new ArrayList<>(container))**;)

- if u **dont want repetition or the same value in different place or u need to preserve order**

  - **use starting index** where every recursive call will start from this index and upwards
  - => **doesn't look at behind values**
  - ex: for(int **index = startingIndex**; index < nums.length; ++index)

- if we have **duplicates** => **sort the array** at first

  - and skip duplicate values if needed

- **check oneNote on how to solve these kinds of questions**

**_Problems_**

#### Which Value At index I (for I: start -> end)

- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)

  - Can be done using Dynamic Programming
  - did it in two ways second is just a refactoring of the first where first
    - first I used: list<list<list<Integer>>> like in combination sum
    - second I used: list<list<Integer>> only
  - but I always have previous row answer and current row answer

- [PermutationsII](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/description/)

  - similar to Permuations but added and if statement
  - SORT Array to have duplicates beside each other => easier to work with
  - this if statement checks if i dont have any value of the same number before the permutation index. Why would that work?
    Since if i have [1,2,3',3,4] (after sorting the array) the second 3 will generate for ex: XX3XX and X3XXX if now im generating the permutations of the first 3' one of the options will be X3'3XX for the XX3XX and the other will be X33'XX for the X3XXX and we have to prevent this duplication. So if we used the if we wont consider X33'XX for the X3XXX since we are inserting it in index 2 and we have a 3 in index 1.
  - [general solution - backtracking](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/46161/a-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-java-subsets-permutations-combination-sum-palindrome-partitioning)

- [Increasing Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/)
  - same as Combination Sum II problem
  - we have duplicates but here we can order => we have to check if we passed a same value and did take it using a loop
    - this for loop:k = start -> i
      - why is it enough to check k from start and not before cz we already took start - 1?
        - cz the last value we took was at startIndex - 1 => we want to check if we skipped same value in range [startIndex, i[
          cz this is the only case if we did, we will have a duplicate
  
  ``` java
    boolean checkIfPassedSameValue(int[] nums, int startIndex,int i) {
      for (int k = startIndex; k < i; k++) {
         if (nums[k] == nums[i]) {
            return true;
         }
      }
      return false;
   }
  ```

- [Palindrome Permutation II](https://leetcode.com/articles/palindrome-permutation-ii/)

  - use the general permutation way (backtracking)

- [Factor Combinations](https://kennyzhuang.gitbooks.io/leetcode-lock/content/254_factor_combinations.html)
  - did it in DFS
    - pass the multiplier as a start point to decompose the multiplicent so that the decomposed factors are >= multiplier
      - => preserve the asc order in the resulting array
    - at every result u get even if its a subproblem add it to the result
      - (we cant wait until we reach the end)
  - I did it using DP
  - can do it like previous problems using DFS (using the general solution)

* [Expression Add Operators](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/description/)

  - did it using backtracking general solution
  - did a double backtracking to have a clearer solution
    1.  one for the numbers only
    2.  the other for the signs
  - used the algo of **BASIC CALCULATOR II**
  - check solution with [one-combined DFS](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/discuss/71895/Java-Standard-Backtrace-AC-Solutoin-short-and-clear)

* [Word Squares](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2016/10/leetcode-425-word-squares.html)

  - used backtracking to get all combinations
  - trie to find the prefix in the previous words
    <a id="Word_Squares"/>

* [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)

  - we dont need duplicate values => use starting Index
  - we need all lengths => at first create loop for length and then call dfs

* [Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/solution/)
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPP problem
  - we do backtracking where at every subproblem we **have two choices at index i its either '(' or ')'**
  - => **try both** until we reach close == n and open == n

#### Multiple choices for index I (ex: take or leave)

- [Generalized Abbreviation](https://gist.github.com/cangoal/bb57a4879a3c892566028b74f1ce50ec)

  - did it in a backtracking way
  - [solution](https://gist.github.com/cangoal/bb57a4879a3c892566028b74f1ce50ec)
  - similar to solution 3 in the above link

  - follow algo as in OneNote
  
- [Word Pattern II](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/07/leetcode-word-pattern-ii-java/)
  - time complexity O(n ^ n)

  - use a bit from [Justifying para DP problem](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/124226772/)

- [Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-invalid-parentheses/)

  - do a normal DFS
  - time O(n)
  - at every index we recurs twice if current char is '(' or ')':
    1.  with this current char
    2.  without the current char
  - we can optimize it more but i didnt do it

- [Android Unlock Patterns](http://www.learn4master.com/interview-questions/leetcode/leetcode-android-unlock-patterns)

  - this problem asks only for the count of the different combinations and not to output the combinations and still we do backtracking

- [Minimum Unique Word Abbreviation](http://shirleyisnotageek.blogspot.com/2016/10/minimum-unique-word-abbreviation.html)

  - did it in a backtracking way
  - 2 steps to solve:
    1. generate Abbreviations of the word
       - generate them in a **smart way** so that u dont generate all of the abbs
       - **If we find the smallest valid Abb we return** => no need to check rest of Abb
    2. For every Abb generated we check if its valid within the Dict
       - if yes => Disregard it and find the next Abb

- [Additive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/description/)

  - Do back tracking
  - if int is so large => keep them as String and do addition on the fly


#### Which Value At index I (for I: start -> end) 2

- [Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/)
  - its like the permutation question where here we need all the different combinations that works
  - we can optimize this DFS a little by checking at every level the conditions that we have on the current Index
    - if it works => take the value and continue recursing
    - if not => skip this value

### DFS/BFS in Matrix

- [Shortest Distance from All Buildings](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-shortest-distance-from-all-buildings-java/)

  - DFS in 2d Array
  - similar to "walls and gates"
  - typical DFS or BFS problem
  - I did it using a DFS, try to do it using BFS
  - pay attention to the trick (all building should reach the spot) i didnt implement that but its easy to do

- [Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels](http://buttercola.blogspot.fr/2016/01/leetcode-smallest-rectangle-enclosing.html)

- [Walls and Gates](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/09/leetcode-walls-and-gates.html)
  - I done 2 ways: DFS and BFS
  - the above solution starts from the gates and finds the empty space, while my solution starts from the empty space and find the gate

- [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/description/)

  - 2 solutions:
    1. pass through every element in matrix and check if it reached pacific and atlantic
       - time: O($n^2 m^2$)
    2. pass through every shore of pacific and atlantic and check which elements they reach

### DFS + MEMO

#### Matrix

- [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/description/)

  - since its a 2D matrix => brute force solution is to do a backtracking algo
  - but since they only need a max value => we can optimize the algo by doing **backtracking + memo** => DP solution O(nm) time
  - [similar to my solution](<https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/discuss/78433/My-DP-solution-with-Explanation-Search-nearby-using-DFS.-O(MN)-Easy-to-read>)
  - In my solution I added a visited 2D array in order to make sure not to visit a cell that is already in the visiting process (check backtracking algos)
  - Some thoughts:
    - I was thinking of doing it in a iterative way rather a recursive way

- [Out of Boundary Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/out-of-boundary-paths/)

  - KnapSack problem can be optimized to use only 1D array instead of 2D array check how you solved it.
  - here the size of the KnapSack = sum(array)/2
  - the weight of the stolen stuff is the values of the array

- [Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/description/#)

  - looks like Knapsack problem
  - time: O(n $\sqrt{n}$)
  - space: O(n)
  - this problem can be solved using a mathematical proof [Lagrange's Four Square theorem]
  - [all solutions](<https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/discuss/71488/Summary-of-4-different-solutions-(BFS-DP-static-DP-and-mathematics)>)

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/solution/)
  - better to solve it in a greedy way
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/description/)

  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - VVVVVVVVIIIIPPPPP problem
  - Solved it in two ways: (check both functions in code)
    1.  solved it in a full DP approach O($k\*I^2$)
    2.  but then i optimized it to O($K\*I$) VVVIIIIPPPPPPP method:
        1.  by saving the state of max profit upon buying a current stock on specific day.
        2.  This specific day should be < current day since the current day is the day to sell this bought stock
        3.  NOTE: buying a current stock at a specific day means that the previous stock should be sold if I bought a previous stock before
  - Equivalence with **Knapsack** => the Sac Size here is the number of transactions and the items here are the prices every day
  - did it in general for K transactions, it looks like Knapsack and stock hw problem
  - [explanation of my solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/4766/a-clean-dp-solution-which-generalizes-to-k-transactions)

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

  - this question has two parts
    1.  if k > prices.length/2 => solve it in a greedy way check [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/solution/)
    2.  else solve it like [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/4766/a-clean-dp-solution-which-generalizes-to-k-transactions)

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/)

  - in this question we dont have a limit on Transactions => no need for second dimension of length K like previous problems
    => only 1 is needed over the prices of every day
  - The problem here is the cool down => we need to keep the max profit after sell up till before yesterday so that we can calculate **maxProfitAfterBuy = max(profitAfterBuy, profitPreviousSell - price[i])**
    => we need to limit current maxProfitPreviousSell to max (i - 2) position
    => we always check max(maxProfitPreviousSell, profitAfterSellOfBeforeYesterday) => max(maxProfitPreviousSell, dp[i - 2])
  - we only need a dp[] to save the profitOfSell on everyday => space complexity O(n)
    - we can optimize the space complexity to O(1) by saving:
      1.  maxProfitPreviousSell (this is max profit after sell up till before yesterday)
      2.  profitMinus2 (profit Of Yesterday)
      3.  profitMinus1 (profit of Current)
  - check my code
  - most optimized algo:
    - time: O(N)
    - space: O(1)

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/description/)

  - => the memo of a dp here is a Map where key is 1s[i] - 0s[i] at index i and value is index i
  - => at every index check if a diff saved in the map already => if yes take the length

- [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)

  - <a id="Maximum_Product_Subarray">Maximum Product Subarray</a>
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - Find a way to do it in O(n) (DP)
  - for O(n) it differs from the of Max Sum Subarray by at every current value we calculate the Min and Max current value **ex: MaxCurrentValue = Math.max(nums[index], Math.max(maxProduct - nums[index], minProduct - nums[index]))** and the same for MinCurrentValue
  - It can be done using Divide and Conquer O(n lgn)
  - for D&C its a bit different from that of Max Sum Subarray by also keeping track of min on Left and min on Right to multiply them by each other and check if their product is the max

- [Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/description/)

  - VVVVVIIIIIIPPPPPPPP problemm
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - can use the solution of [Longest Palindromic Substring](#Longest_Palindromic_Substring) with some modification
  - In a string every char may be considered as a palindrom by its own
    - => initial value of the dp[i] = i
  - the modification is whenever you have a palindrome (even if its not the largest one) check the necessary on cntds on it!!!!!
  - It was so hard to solve it despite the solution was easy

        return dp[num] = 1 + solve(num/2);
    else
      return dp[num] = 1 + min(solve(num+1), solve(num-1));
  ```

- [Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/description/)

  - Iterative DP
  - **prefix problem x[0: i]**
  - Time: O(n^2) space O(n^2)
  - we iterate over every stone and then look at all previous stones to check if we can reach current stone from previous one (under cnd newK [oldK - 1, oldK + 1])

- [Bomb Enemy](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2016/06/leetcode-361-bomb-enemy.html)

  - easy to do it in brute force
  - but we can do it in time: O(mn) and space O(n) where m = rows and n = columns
  - check the solution in the link or check my solution
  - the brute force method is doing the same stuff many times so if we use a dp we can get the info needed of the current cell from the previous cell

- [Split Array Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/description/)

  - similar to **text justification** but taking into consideration the number of arrays as a constraint
  - 5 Steps:
    1. Subproblems:
       - we have to do the **text justification like algo** for every number of Arrays (numberOfArrays 1 -> m)
       - **text justification like algo**:
         - min sum for suffix array[i:]
       - $\#subproblems = O(m\*nums.length)$
    2. Guess:
       - where to end current array, say i:j
       - $\#choice = O(nums.length)$
    3. Recurrence:
       - dp[row][i] = min(max(sum(i, j), dp[row - 1][j - 1] for j in range({0 or row} -> i)))
       - $time/Subproblem = O(nums.length)$
    4. Order:
       1. row (++): 1 -> m
       2. i (--): nums.length - 1 -> row
       - $Total Time = \#subproblems * time/Subproblem = O(m*nums.length^2)$

* [Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/description/)
  - At first we have to save for every prime factor its minimum index (call it Mi) which is the index that points to a value in values array and we will use it to get next Ugly Number = PrimFactor \* values[Mi]
  - loop for 1 -> n
    - check which prime factor will generate the current min ugly number
      - for every prime factor to generate current ugly number = prime factor \* values[Mi]
    - when current min ugly number is calculated **loop over all the prime factors and check if (current min ugly number) % prime factor == 0**
      - if it is => **increment Prime factor's Mi**

##### Several Options/States (ex: rob or dont rob)

- [Paint House](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-paint-house-java/)

  - [optimal solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/32408/share-my-very-simple-java-solution-with-explanation)
  - this optimal solution is like mine

- [Paint House II](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-paint-house-ii-java/)

  - solution with time: O(nk) and O(1) space (check my code) or [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/22580/ac-java-solution-without-extra-space)
  - explanation:
    - The idea is similar to the problem Paint House I, for each house and each color, the minimum cost of painting the house with that color should be the minimum cost of painting previous houses, and make sure the previous house doesn't paint with the same color.
      - We can use min1 and min2 to track the indices of the 1st and 2nd smallest cost till previous house, if the current color's index is same as min1, then we have to go with min2, otherwise we can safely go with min1.
      - The code below modifies the value of costs[][] so we don't need extra space.
  
- <a id="House_Robber"/> [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)

  - can be solved in a dp way with an array but we can optimize to use two fields (whether to rob current or not)
  - its based on whether to rob current house or not:
    - to rub current house = val[i] + dontRobPreviousHouse
    - not to rob current house = max(to rob previous, not to rob previous)

- [House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/description/)

  - looks a bit like the [House Robber problem](#House_Robber)
  - think about it as HouseRobber for every house save wether to rob or not rob
  - but do it in a bottom-up manner => post order traversal:
    =>
    - so to decide if rob current => two children not robbed
    - to not rob current => Max(left.rob, left.notRob) + Max(right.rob, right.notRob)
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/discuss/79330/Step-by-step-tackling-of-the-problem)

- [Wiggle Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/description/)
  - to solve this problem we need to count the number of alterantions between a Maxima and a Minima
  - time: O(n), Space: O(1)
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/articles/wiggle-subsequence/)
  - similar to **finding the number of alternating max. and min. peaks in the array**

- [Sherlock and Cost](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-cost/problem)

  - looks a bit like the [House Robber problem](
  - Algo gor guess:
    - lowValue = Math.max(prevLowValue, Math.abs(B[index + 1] - 1) + highValue);
    - highValue = Math.max(Math.abs(B[index] - 1) + prevLowValue, Math.abs(B[index] - B[index + 1]) + highValue);

- [Counting Boolean Parenthesizations]()
  - check Recitation 5 in DP course 2

#### COUNT

- [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/)

  - determine the number of ways to decode? => we start with the initial value = 1 and just add
  - Pay Attention to corner cases cz "0" can't exist by itself since coding starts from 1 to 26 so if we reach "0" we should skip it (in a way cz we still have to process the two pointers)
  - Its an easy DP problem

- [Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/)

  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - this question is similar to **Decode Ways** problems since both ask the number of ways to... and both are DP => the initial value of both is 1 for empty string
  - the relation for the other indices are just adding the previous values (ex: dp[i] = dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 2])

- [Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)
  - Suppose for sequences ending at nums[i], we knew the length length[i] of the longest sequence, and the number count[i] of such sequences with that length.
  - For every i < j with A[i] < A[j], we might append A[j] to a longest subsequence ending at A[i]. It means that we have demonstrated count[i] subsequences of length length[i] + 1.
  - Now, if those sequences are longer than length[j], then we know we have count[i] sequences of this length. If these sequences are equal in length to length[j], then we know that there are now count[i] additional sequences to be counted of that length (ie. count[j] += count[i]).
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/solution/)


- [Paint Fence](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-pain-fence-java/)

  - looks like the [House Robber problem](#House_Robber)
  - use traversal DP to solve this
  - O(n)
  - not necessary to use array[n] its sufficient to use only to variable (paintLikePrevious, dontPaintLikePrevious) => space: O(1)

- [Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/)
  - here we have to count the number of combinations;
  - [explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/discuss/92822/Detailed-explanation-for-Java-O(n2)-solution)
  - My explanation:
    - so for every value in the array we check the diff with preceding values and if the preceding valeus have the same diff with other values
    - when we get a match => add the number of combination of the preciding values to the sum
      - why at current value we add the combinations of the preceding values?
        - since this combination value will actually be the number of combinations of the current value joind with the preceding values 

- [Jump II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/discuss/)
  * resolve it or even solve [Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)
  * we can use a greedy algorithm to solve it no need for DP 

- [Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/)
  - we are doing suffex dp here
  - subproblems: we have n subproblems where n is length of array => subproblems: O(n)
  - choices: for every subproblem i we have from i+1 -> n choices => choices: O(n)
  - => time : O(nˆ2)
  - However they did a [greedy solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/solution/)

#### TRUE / FALSE (think of Rec + Memo)

- Why True/False questions work with DP? - Since sometimes we can do backtracking (to get the answer)

  - And then add Memo => DP

- [Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/)

  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/articles/interleaving-strings/)
  - VVVVIIPPPPP problem should solve it again(I solved like this one in the past but cant remember which question)
  - wrote it in two DP ways:
    1.  Topo way: O(n) space with two arrays, O(m\*n) complexity
    2.  recursive + memo: O(m* n) space, O(m*n) complexity
  - you dont need to consider a dimension in the memo for s3 since indexS3 = indexS1 + indexS2 (always try to reduce ur complexity)
    so if we have dp[indexS1][indexS2] its answer will always refer to (index1, index2, index3) where indexS3 = indexS1 + indexS2 and nothing else

- [Nim Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/description/)
  - looks like **alternating coin game lecture 10 course 2**
  - somehow we have to find dp[n] = max(min(...), min(....))
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/discuss/134338/Formal-way-of-dynamic-programming-(DP))

- [Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/description/)
  - Iterative DP
  - **prefix problem x[0: i]**
  - Time: O(n^2) space O(n^2)
  - we iterate over every stone and then look at all previous stones to check if we can reach current stone from previous one (under cnd newK [oldK - 1, oldK + 1])

- [](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/description/)

  - check [Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/description/) which was solved using recursion
  - solved this problem using topo sort
  - its a DP similar to Edit Distance with some modifications


#### Find all possible answers

- [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/)

  - its a typical DP problem
  - It would be slow to to save all the String combinations while doing the DP instead for starting index save the possible ending indices
  - and then after finishing the DP do a DFS starting from index 0
  - solution like what i did [check solution 2](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/03/leetcode-word-break-ii-java/)

### SubString x[i:j]

- [Different Ways to Add Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **STUDY THIS PROBLEM**
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - NOTE: looks like the Matrix Multiplication DP problem in course
  - can do it recursively and iter dp
  - time O(2^n) since we are outputting all the combinations and not the max
  - I thought i can do it like the the [general solution in the permutation] but it seems it cant be solved cz its hard to remove duplicate solutions
  - [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/26076/java-recursive-9ms-and-dp-4ms-solution)

- [Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/description/)

  - The difference btw scrambling and permutation is that in scrambling a subtree for the first word should have the same letters (diff order) as a subtree in the second word
  - looking at the example they gave, subtree "eat" and "tae" have the same letters but scrambled since subtree "at" and "ta" are scramble and "e" == "e" => these subtrees are scrambled with respect to each other
  - The important thing is that the sibling of the leaf nodes are the same in both trees (ex: "a" and "t" are sibling in "at" subtree and "t" and "a" are sibling in "ta") and ("e" and "at" are sibling in "eat" and "ta" and "e" are sibling in "tae" => "eat" and "tea" are scramble with respect to each other)
  - **_note: in order to know if two substrings are scramble They should have the same LENGTH_** => THATS WHY WE HAVE A LOOP OVER LENGTH
  - This problem looks like **Parenthesis DP Problem** (from inside to outside)
  - could be done in O(n^3) using DP and recursion.
  - check discussion to see the idea behind in for more info if you needed

- [Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/discuss/76228/Share-some-analysis-and-explanations)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - this problem is **substring DP x[i:j]** just like the Parenthesis dp problem course 1 lec21
  - the **trick** in this problem is: Instead of divide the problem by the first balloon to burst, we divide the problem by the last balloon to burst.

- [Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/description/)
  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - Did it in 3 ways:
    1. using normal DP => O(KN)
    2. optimized it to become O(N) but still gave me time exceed since we are passing from 1 -> N one by one
    3. from solutions given by other people: [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/discuss/78488/Solution-+-explanation)
    - this solution is not intuative at all => its sooooo hardddd
    - read the explanation in the solution above carefully

# Graphs

**_Hints_**

- Should know DFS, BFS, Topological Sort

## BFS / DFS

- [Valid Tree](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/graph-valid-tree-java/)
  - Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), check if these edges form a valid tree.
  - change list to adj Matrix (edges are undirected)
  - do a DFS with a boolean[] visited to detect if a node points to a visited node
    - if it does => we fail
    - if it doesn't => its a tree

- [Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)
  - normal DFS algo using AdjMatrix
  - upon iterating on the nodes in the highest level:
    - if this nodes isnt yet visited => it will be a new root node in its seperate graph => new circle of friendship
  - This problem can also be solved in Union Find
    - It looks similar to NumberOfIslands problem
    - but here we are counting the number of friendships circles  

### Level Traversal

**_Hints_**

- its a modified BFS (check oneNote)
- add for loop to only traverse every time the current level nodes

- [Level By Level](#level-by-level)

---

## TOPO Sort / Dependency

- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/#)

  - its a dependency problem and we must find a cycle
  - so we can do it using topolical sort or DFS if at a certain point the adj vertex is grey => we have a cycle
  - pay attention when they say **to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]** => the is directed

- [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/)

  - we must output the courses in the needed order => TOPOLOGICAL SORT

- [alien language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/)

  - The idea is to create a graph of characters and then find topological sorting of the created graph.
  - Following are the detailed steps:

    1. Create a graph g with number of vertices equal to the size of alphabet in the given alien language. For example, if the alphabet size is 5, then there can be 5 characters in words. Initially there are no edges in graph.

    2. Do following for every pair of adjacent words in given sorted array.

       - Let the current pair of words be word1 and word2. One by one compare characters of both words and find the first mismatching characters.
       - Create an edge in g from mismatching character of word1 to that of word2.

    3. Print topological sorting of the above created graph.

## Dijkstra

- [Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/description/)
  - I used a modified version of Dijkstra
  - the relaxing method is diff here
    - instead of d[u] = d[v] + w(u, v)
    - we use d[u] = Max(d[v], grid[u])

## From START -> END state (state ex: word, char, number, fraction...)

- [Minimum Genetic Mutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/)
  <a id="Minimum_Genetic_Mutation"></a>
  - We want to go from start word to end word => minimum DFS
  - Vertex: every String in bank
  - Edges: edges btw words are available if word1 and word2 diff only by 1 gene
    - I used **Trie** to check if we can create an edge btw two words
  - [solution](<https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/discuss/160892/Java-DP(DFS-and-memo)-+-Trie>)

* [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/)

  - similar Explanation as [Minimum Genetic Mutation](#Minimum_Genetic_Mutation)

* [Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/description/)

  - its similar to **alien language problem**
  - make every String in the equations a vertex => the numerators and denominators arte vertices
  - the edges btw the vertices are weighted => weight btw 2 vertices X and Y = to X/Y
  - => to calculate the division btw X/Y we should do a DFS or BFS from X to Y
  - **NOTE: I DONT CARE WHAT GRAPH ALGO I USE CZ THE DIVISION WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME => SAME TO USE DFS OR DIJKASTRA**

* [Largest Divisible Subset](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - Solution 1:
    - I started to think about this solution as a graph
      - every number is a vertex
      - and every Si % Sj = 0 || Sj % Si = 0 is a directed edge between Vj and Vi depends which is bigger
        - to prevent doing Si % Sj = 0 || Sj % Si = 0 => sort the nums in asc order
    - To make life easier upon building the graph try to make it directly a MST (in this case Maximum Spanning Tree) which means for every:
      - we only have one parent
      - the node will be assigned to the parent that has the longest path (not shortest!!)
    - upon building the graph save also the longest path in order to return it at the end
    - basically this Algo is a DFS => Time: O(n^2), Space: O(n)
  - Solution 2:
    - I tried to optimize Solution 1
    - Start by sorting the nums as above solution
    - Then iterate through nums, upon every value find if its divisors are within the array (should be already treated)
      - to find the divisors => loop i: 1 -> i\*i <= currentValue
      - find the divisor with the longest Path that is available
        - make this divisor as parent of current Value (to get the result array at the end)
        - make the path length of currentValue = path length of longest divisor + 1
    - at the end since we have the longest value => backtrack to find the sequence
    - time: O(n sqrt(n)), Space: O(n)

* [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/description/)

  - its a nice problem
  - do a typical DFS
  - since we need the final answer the list lexical order and to save some time from comparing every answer => **order every adj node for a node**
  - if we reach a solution where we have total number of tickets = to number of tickets we have now => return true and finish
    => dont search anymore
  - **NOTE**:
    1. Thus it’s natural to think about the “backtracking” feature of DFS.
    2. We start by building a and then sorting vertices in the adjacency list so that when we traverse the later, we can guarantee the lexical order of the itinerary can be as good as possible.
    3. When we have generated an itinerary, we check if we have used all our airline tickets. If not, we revert the change and try another ticket. We keep trying until we have used all our tickets.

- [K-diff Pairs in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/)
  - similar to 2sum in the concept where upon iteration we check if the diff is already in the hashTable and then we add the current value to the hashTable 

- [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)
  * Description : Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence
  * did this problem in a hard way but you could do it in a much simpler way [my solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/6148/my-really-simple-java-o-n-solution-accepted)
  * __Needs REVIEW__   
  * __Practice this problem more__
  * check this [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/25493/simple-fast-java-solution-using-set)

- [Brick Wall](https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/)
  - The idea is straightforward, 
  - since each brick length is positive, we can record all the edge index (ending Index of a brick) in the wall and figure out which edge index is the most common. 
  - We cut through that edge index, it will cross number of rows - most common edge count rows
  - Use a Map to record the freq of bricks ending at index I
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/discuss/137777/Java-Map-solution)

- [Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/)
  - sort then create hashTable
  - remember BitSetWithRank code

- [Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)
  - I did it in O(n) with hashtable but their solution is much simpler
    - their Algo:
      - they just saved the freq per val in the map
      - and then check for map.get(num) + map.get(num + 1) or map.get(num) + map.get(num - 1)
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/solution/)
  ``` java
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        HashMap < Integer, Integer > map = new HashMap < > ();
        int res = 0;
        for (int num: nums) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            if (map.containsKey(num + 1))
                res = Math.max(res, map.get(num) + map.get(num + 1));
            if (map.containsKey(num - 1))
                res = Math.max(res, map.get(num) + map.get(num - 1));
        }
        return res;
    }
  
  ```

# Heap

- [Rearrange String k Distance Apart](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/08/leetcode-rearrange-string-k-distance-apart-java/)
  - I solved it like the solution
  - use a MaxQueue to store the char based on their current Frequency.
  - every time you use remove a char from the queue:
    1. add it to the StringBuilder
    2. decrement its freq
    3. add it to a set (name it InWindow) of chars currently within window K if its freq > 0
    else throw it away
    1. at the end try to remove the char of stringBuilder.charAt(length - k) from InWindow and add it again to the MaxQueue

- [Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/)
  - create a map to store the end of a sequence at every point of iteration (key is the value of last element in sequ and value in the size of the seq)
  - Actually the value of the map is a priorityqueue that stores a list of size of sequences that end with the key value
  - time: O(n logn)

## Kth smallest/Largest...

- [Merge k Sorted Lists](#merge_k_Sorted_Lists)

- [Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](#kth_Smallest_Element_in_a_Sorted_Matrix)

- [Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/description/)
  - to solve this problem i used MinQueue
  - at any time the elements in the min queue are O(k) elements
  - time: O(k log k)
  - Algo:
    - at first we start by habing {0,0} indecies in the minQueue
    - when we pop a pair from the queue we should:
      - add minPair to result
      - add pair {minPair[0] + 1, minPair[1] + 1} to minQueue
      - check minPair[0] < nums1.length - 1 && minPair[1] == 0 ? => add {minPair[0] + 1, minPair[1]} to minQueue
        - **why?** cz we need to make sure that pair {minPair[0] + 1, minPair[1] + 1} is less than {minPair[0] + 1, minPair[1]}
    - keep doing this until we reach size = k

- [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)

# Linked List

**_Hints_**

- Try to use **DummyHead**
- Runner technique: use more than one pointers separated btw each other with a constant distance (cracking coding interview p93)
- If end -> beginning (reverse order) **ex: Plus One Linked List** => 2 ways:
  1. recursive
  2. reverse order + compute + reverse order again
- when re-arranging nodes make sure to change node.next to appropraite value or null
  - ex: **Odd Even Linked List**

**_Problems_**


- [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)
  * use two pointers with distance K

- [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/description/)

## Pow / SQRT

- [pow](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

  - can be done in O(log n)
  - we have **2 corner cases**:
    - we do the **if(n < 0)** after the recursive call and not before

  - check their solution

- [Power of Four](<https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/discuss/80456/O(1)-one-line-solution-without-loops>)
  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - 2 ways:
    1.  return Integer.bitCount(num) == 1&& Integer.numberOfTrailingZeros(num) % 2 == 0;
    2.  return (num > 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0) && ((num & 0x55555555) == num);
    - The basic idea is from power of 2, We can use “n&(n-1) == 0” to determine if n is power of 2.
    - For power of 4, the additional restriction is that in binary form, the only “1” should always located at the odd position.
    - For example, 4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 100, 4^2 = 10000.
    - So we can use “num & 0x55555555==num” to check if “1” is located at the odd position.
  - **second solution is better cz it doesn't depend on a specific language**

- [Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/description/)

  - VVVVVVIIIIPPPPPPP
  - Idea uses **arithmetic series calculation**
  - There are 3 steps to do here
    1. we need to find the appropriate windows for the series determind
       - I used two pointers left and right
       - As long as A[right] - A[right - 1] = Current_Window_Diff we ++right => current window increase
    2. Determine number of **combinations per window**
       - this is the arithmetic series calculation part
       - $count/window = \sum*{j= 3}^{len} \sum*{k= 3}^{j} 1 = \dfrac{(len - 2)\*(len - 1) }{2}$
    3. Total count = sum(combinations per window)
  - time O(n)

### Sliding window

**_Hints_**

- Think about **you will have start and end index**
- String matching Algo:

  - [Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)
    - [check how Hash Function is done](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-3-rabin-karp-algorithm/)
    - in the hash function we dont care about the length of the hash value cz its always mod p (p is prime)
    - check recitation of lecture 9 course 1
    - append(val) = (u*a + val) mod p = (u mod p) * a + val mod p
    - skip(val) = (u - val _ (a^(|u| - 1) mod p) mod p = ((u mod p) - val _ (a^(|u| - 1) mod p)) mod p
  - [Knuth-Morris-Pratt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6dCOa_gMoY)

- [GasStation](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/discuss/)
  - algo is similar to [Generic Sliding Window Pattern](#generic-sliding-window-pattern)

#### Longest/Shortest Sequence/String

**_Hints_**

<a id="generic-sliding-window-pattern"></a>
- Generic Pattern 1 vs Generic Pattern 2: (**VVVIIIPPPPPP** check **Minimum Window Substring** problem to see the diff btw the 2 patterns)
  - 1: end starts from 0; 
  - 2: end start from -1

 
- Generic Pattern 1: end starts from 0;
  
  ``` java

    static int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s, int k) {
      // do proper initialization as per the question
      Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
      int maxSize = 0;

      // start from zero in both left and right pointers
      int start = 0;
      int end = 0;
      int length = s.length();

      // here make sure end < length
      while (start < length && end < length) {

            }
         }
      }

      return maxSize;
    }
  ```


- Generic Pattern 2: end start from -1

``` java

           // do question logic for what we need upon incrementing left
            // this part should be substituted with specific question logic
            // this part can be omitted we are fetching for a max but since here w are fetching for a min => we need it

**_Problems_**

- [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/124633862/)

  - its similar to <a id="Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters">[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)</a>
  - its a sliding window problem
  - it will always contain a while loop and mostly the condition for the first while loop is (end < s.length>)
  - in these types of problems we have to think about a sliding window where it has a beginning and end pointers => we compute the answer with O(n)
  - if they say its a charac then we are working with ascii then use int[128] to save ur data
  - look at this [generic form](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/161215/Easy-Understand-Java-Solution)

- [Subarray Product Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/)
  - keep to pointers left and right 
  - keep on incrementing the right until the cum >= k
    - then start incrementing the left until u reach cum < k || left == right
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/solution/)
  
- [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/)
  * time complexity O(n)
  * did it in a greedy way like (__Max Subarray problem__) but kept a queue to try to remove the first element whenever the sum reached the needed limit
  check [submission one](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/135521401/) but __SPACE__ complexity was O(n)
  * found out that we can do it without a queue we just need to pointer (begining and end pointers) to manipulated the queue since the values in the queue will be contiguous btw beginning and end pointers
  => __SPACE__ complexity is now O(1) [check solution]

  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - here we have to do like the Amortized HW in course 2 (queue with MIN in O(1) amortized)
  - use the same algo
  - check code or [solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/19055/java-o-n-solution-using-deque-with-explanation)

* [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)

  - this is solved using time: O(n)
  - space O(1) due to int[26] to save the count per char
  - we can use sliding window to solve this problem

* [Flip bit to Win](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-longest-sequence-1s-binary-representation-one-flip/)

  - we can use 3 pointers:
    - index for current index
    - firstZero for the first previous zero encountered
    - secondZero for the second previous zero encountered
  - when ever index reaches a zero
    - calculate longestSequence = Max(longestSequence, index - secondZero - 1)
  - time: O(b)
  - space: O(1)

  ```java
   static int flip(int n) {
      int firstZero = -1;
      int secondZero = -1;

      int index = 0;
      int mask = 1;
      int longestSequence = 0;

      while(index < 32) {
         if ((mask & n) == 0) {
            longestSequence = Math.max(longestSequence, index - secondZero - 1);
            secondZero = firstZero;
            firstZero = index;
         }

* [Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)
  - similar to **Flip bit to Win** problem

- [Unique Substrings in Wraparound String](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-substrings-in-wraparound-string/)
  - here we have a left and right pointer
  - right pointer will keep incrementing until we reach (p.charAt(rightPointer - 1) - 'a' + 1) % 26 == p.charAt(rightPointer) - 'a')
    - this means that the my previous char isnt the my char - 1 (take into consideration the alphabatical cycle)
  - when we stop the right pointer => calculate the possible combination btw left and right
  - then memo the max length of substring, we have until now, starting from each char btw left and right 
  - calculate the total number of combinations while memoing

- [Jump II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/discuss/)
  - resolve it or even solve [Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)
  - we can use a greedy algorithm to solve it no need for DP
  - to optimize do it using (left/right) pointers


#### Rabin-Karp

- [Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/)
  - Here we have to apply the [Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)

---

## Start / End Pointers

- [Beautiful Arrangement II](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/)
  - we want in the array k distinct value of the diff btw arr[i] and arr[i-1]
  - => we can make smart decision by following:
    - 1,n,2,n-1,3,n-2,4... ==> Diff: n-1, n-2, n-3, n-4, n-5...
    - By following this pattern, k numbers will have k-1 distinct difference values;
    - and all the rest numbers should have |ai - a_i-1| = 1;
    - In total, we will have k-1+1 = k distinct values.
  - This means that to get the first k-1 distinct value we do
    - 1,n,2,n-1,3,n-2....
  - and at the end we are left with 1 more ditict diff => we either
    - if k is even we do small+1, small+2, small+3...
    - or if k is odd we do large-1, large-2,large-3....

``` java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructArray(int n, int k) {
        if(k>=n) return null;
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        int i = 0, small = 1, large = n;        
        while(i<k){ 
            arr[i++] = small++;
            if(i<k) arr[i++] = large--;
        }        
        if(k%2 == 0){ // k==2 ==> 1, 6, 5,4,3,2
            while(i<arr.length) arr[i++] = large--;
        } else { // k==3 ==> 1,6,2,3,4,5
            while(i<arr.length) arr[i++] = small++;
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

### Calculate Value btw them

**_Hints_**

- you may want to sort at first

**_Problems_**


- [Reverse Vowels of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/)
  * use two pointers to find the left and right vowel
  * we u find them swap
  * then ++left , --right => do this until left >right

- [Line Reflection](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/08/leetcode-line-reflection-java/)

  - the idea here is to group all the points with the same y-cordinate and then check if two points reflect on the same y-line
  - how to know what are the two points to compare to?
    1. sort all points on the same y-axis and then start with the extreme points and check if they reflect on the same line => check my code
    - time: O(n logn)
    1. no need to sort, just take the furthest and closes point and check there reflection line, then for every point check if x = CurrentX - reflection is in the set we have
       and this x should have same y as the
    - time: O(n)

- [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/discuss/)

  - two pointers:
    - one on the start
    - one on the end
  - calculate the area btw these two pointers with minHeight = min(heightStart, heightEnd)
  - and dont forget to remove the area of current lower height from the whole area

- [Sort Transformed Array](http://shirleyisnotageek.blogspot.com/2016/10/sort-transformed-array.html)
  - We know that the transformation function forms a parabola, which has a minimum/maximum in the middle,
    - if a == 0.=> line => return b >= 0 ? nums : reverse(nums)
    - if a > 0
      => So we can start from two ends, fill the result array from end to start, for a < 0, fill the result array from start to end  
      (like the merge function in merge sort)

## Pointer for each String/Array

- [Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/)
  - it looks like DP (longest common subsequence) but here we dont want max of choices
  - we want if s.charAt(i1) != s1.chatAt(i1) => assume its a delete else go to next chars
  - Algo:
    - iterate over each string in Dictionary
    - and do this 2 pointer travesal algo
    - then get the longest with the smallest lexo string
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/solution/)

``` java

        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < y.length() && j < x.length(); i++)
            if (x.charAt(j) == y.charAt(i))
                j++;
        return j == x.length();
    }

                if (str.length() > max_str.length() || (str.length() == max_str.length() && str.compareTo(max_str) < 0))
                    max_str = str;
            }
        }
        return max_str;

- [Check If a String Can Break Another String](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/)
  - Can be done using Two pointer approach time O(n)
  - I did it using Sortig both strings time O(n logn)
  - Solution for 2 pointer appraoch:

# Regex

**_Hints_**

- if I use trimmed.split("\\s+") on empty string ""
  => it will create an array of size 1

---

- [Number of Segments in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-segments-in-a-string/solution/)

  - we trim the string and then check if its empty since the split will create an array of size 1 if string was "" (empty string)
  - trimmed.split("\\s+")

- [Compare Version Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/discuss/)
  - did it in 2 ways:
    1. using normal iteration (while loop over every char)
    2. using String.split("\\.")
  - VVVVVVVIIIIIPPPPPPPP
  - **_NOTE:_** instead of iterating over every char in the outer While loop use nested while loop the inner loop will iterate until it reaches a DOT

  - I did it in a different way
  - MY way:
    - calculated the total distance with respect to x = 0 and y = 0
    - then start traversing right and sub 1 from every valid point on my right
    - and add 1 for every valid point on my left
    - do similar process when traversing the rows
    - at every traversal check if we have a Min
  - [Solution Way:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-meeting-point-2d-binary-array/)
    - Store all horizontal and vertical positions of all group member.
    - Now sort it to find minimum middle position, which will be the best meeting point.
    - Find the distance of all members from best meeting point

## Mapping

- [Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/)
  - use array of 128 or 256
  - Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
  - All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## D&G



- [Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
  - time: O(log n)
  - idea heare how to choose wether to go left or right
    - go left :if the same value is in mid - 1 index => if the left part of array is even => the single element is in left part else in right
    - go right : if the same value is in mid + 1 index => if the right part of array is even => the single element is in right part else in right

### Quick Select

**_Hints_**

- check oneNote for explanation

**_Problems_**

- [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/)
  - use Quick Select
  - pay attention how to pick the pivot [use ur solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
  - and how to decide if u recurse left or right here is reversed from the normal quick sort since they ask for the kth largest and not smallest
  - O(n)
  - VVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

### Binary Search

**_Hints_**

- pay attention when calculating the mid (from **overflow**) use **int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2)**
  - do **int mid = (start + end) >>> 1** __if its values are position__
  - => if values may be negative => use **int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2)**
    - since it will break https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19106350/explanation-of-the-safe-average-of-two-numbers
- check oneNote for explanation

**_Problems_**

- [H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/description/)

  - can be solved in binary search

  ```java
    int rankLargest = citations.length - mid;

    if (rankLargest > citations[mid]) {
        start = mid + 1;
    } else {
        maxCitation = Math.max(maxCitation, rankLargest);
        end = mid - 1;
    }
  ```

- [Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)

  - its a normal binary search
  - the trick here is to watch for **overflow** when calculating the mid
    - so dont write int mid = (start + end)/2
    - u should write int mid = start + ((end-start) /2);
  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/articles/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

- [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/)
  - remember how a binary search is written
  - Approch:
    - do a binary search on rows
      - if row[0] > target => Binary search from start -> mid - 1
      - if row[row.length - 1] < target => Binary search from mid + 1 -> end
      - else
        - do binary search on column
          - if found retunr
          - else do two binary search
            - Binary search from start -> mid - 1 and Binary search from mid + 1 -> end
  - time: O(row log(column))

    * if the target <= nums[-1] => search for target in range between mini position and end of array
    * else search in the range between 0 and mini position
  * This is done in O(lg n)
  
- [Search In Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)
  * On average its ganna be O(lg n) but in some cases when value of min equals to value of last then we have to search the whole array to know where the minimum value starts(check cases in test)   
  * So we can say that the runtime will be O(n) in worst case

- [Elimination Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/description/)

  - it was hard to figure out the solution but I was approaching it
  - [explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/discuss/87119/JAVA:-Easiest-solution-O(logN)-with-explanation)
  - solution:
    - The list is a arithmetic progression.
    - It can be represent by a vector v = (S, N, D).
    - S means the value of first element,
    - N means number of element in this list,
    - D means difference between the consecutive elements.
    - So the original list is (S=1,N=n,D=1).
    - After each elimination, the list will remain a arithmetic progression. N will be N/2; D will be 2\*D; S will be S or S+D;

  ```java
   static int lastRemaining(int n) {
      int D = 1;
      int S = 1;
      boolean forward = true;
      while (n > 1) {
         if (forward) {
            S += D;
         } else {
            if ((n & 1) != 0) {
               S += D;
            }
         }
         n >>= 1;
         forward = !forward;
         D <<= 1;
      }
      return S;

# Serialization / Deserialization / Decoding

**_Hints_**

- **StringJoiner** for serialization
  - use a delimiter to **separate btw values** of nodes
- **StringTokenizer** for deserialization
- represent **null nodes** as "#"

**_Problems_**

- [Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

  - VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - **Practice this problem more**
  - I used StringJoiner for serialization
  - I used StringTokenizer for deserialization
  - I did it using PreOrder traversal (DFS):
    - Here we dont need InOrder traversal also like problem (build BST from Inorder and Preorder) since when we reach a null we put in the String as #
      => we know when we reach null and we have to return
    - Used StringJoiner to serialize BST and StringTokenizer to deserialize BST
  - [BFS like LEETCODE OJ](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/discuss/74260/Recursive-DFS-Iterative-DFS-and-BFS)

- [Serialize and Deserialize an N-ary Tree](http://massivealgorithms.blogspot.com/2015/10/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree.html)
  - I used StringJoiner for serialization
  - I used StringTokenizer for deserialization
  - **since its an N-ary** =>
    - when serializing **add the length of Children**
    - when deserializing **use the length of children** to know how many children per node

* [Encode and Decode Strings](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/09/leetcode-encode-and-decode-strings.html)
  - the solution that i did is the same as in the link above
  - to encode the list<String> to string => for every String in the list we add at the end of it


- [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)
  * if you reach a digit => try to build the number => this number is timesToRepeat upcoming chars inside '[]'
  * if we reach a '[' => we need to call the deconding method recursively
  * if we reach a ']' => we should return the method with a return value of the String that was build inside this method
  * if we reach a __Char other than above__ => add it to String
  * make the index iterating over the Original String as public field

# Sorting

**_Hints_**

- use Arrays.sort()
- list.sort()
- Collections.binarySearch()

**_Problems_**

## Merge Sort

### K sorted lists

- [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/discuss/?page=1)

  <a id="merge_k_Sorted_Lists"></a>

  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/solution/)
  - use priorityQueue which size of rows => the queue contains one element from each row

- [Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/description/)<a id="kth_Smallest_Element_in_a_Sorted_Matrix"></a>

  - similar to **Merge k Sorted Lists**
  - VVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

- [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)
  - We can use here an algo similar to **Merge k Sorted Lists**
  - Explaination: 
    - We create a PriorityQeueue per index in the outputted virtual array and every PriorityQeueue is a Max Queue based on the frequency per task.
    - Initialize all the nodes and add them in the PriorityQeueue at index Zero
    - We create a main PriorityQeueue where every node represents the index of PriorityQeueues in the virtual array
      - this pq contains queues only with index i <= current index in virtual array
    - Upon interation from count = 0 -> n (where n is the last index of the virtual array built)
      - we check if we have a PriorityQeueue in the map that is equal to the current iteration Index in order to take it's values into consideration
      - we poll from the main PriorityQeueue, if the task still has more counts, you add this task to the PriorityQeueue where its expected to be available next

            int i = Arrays.binarySearch(dp, 0, len, num);
            if (i < 0) {
                i = -(i + 1);
            }
            dp[i] = num;

  - **Practice this problem more**
  - **Needs REVIEW** \* did it using DP in time: O(n^2)and space O(n)
  - can optimize to **O(n log n) time by and space O(n)**:

    1. using an augmented balanced BST where every node contains the max increasing subseq among nodes that are equal or greater to current node: [solution](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rpeng/CS3510_F16/notes/Oct17LIS.pdf)
    2. using [patience sorting](https://prezi.com/uunlirdphxts/patience-sorting/)

  - [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/solution/)
  - for the optimized solutions I thought about the Augmented BST => explanation of BST:

    1. we start traversing from i: n-1 -> 0
    2. at every index we try to insert its value to a BST. This BST is an Augmented BST by saving at every node the max increasing subseq size among nodes that are equal or greater to current traveresed node
    3. when we reach the place that we want to insert the value we will already have the max sub sequence size starting with this value call it VcurrentMax
    4. traverse again the tree to find the current inserted value to check at each node which has a value smaller than the inserted node if the VcurrentMax is greater than the nodesMax

  - => we can traverse level by level an set the first value in every level as a left most until we reach the end
  - why setting the first value?
    - cz we are doing a BFS starting from left to right at every level

- [All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/description/)
  - Appraoch:
    - we need to know if the distance from target coming from:
      - myself or parent
        - How we know: by passing a distance param in the method
        - What do we do:
          - check if current node's distance == k => add and return
          - else pass distance + 1 to children
      - left child or right child
        - How we know: from the return distance value from the children
        - What do we do:
          - check if current node's distance == k => add and return current node's distance
          - revisit the child that doesnt have the target node in it's subtree

* [Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/solution/)

  - did in a recursive way

  - visit at first right most before left most child

* [Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://www.programcreek.com/2014/07/leetcode-find-leaves-of-binary-tree-java/)

  - use post order traversal to do it
  - leaf nodes have level = 1
  - inner nodes have level = Max(node.left.level, node.right.leve) + 1

* [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)

  - used Post Order traversal where this recursion function at every node returns Math.max(root.val, root.val + leftSum, root.val + rightSum) as a value to its parent
    which means it returns the Max value of a path from this current node to one of its child
  - In addition to that it compares with the globalMaxValue if one of root.val, root.val + leftSum, root.val + rightSum, root.val + rightSum + leftSum is greater than globalMaxValue to set it as the new globalMaxValue. As you can see **root.val + rightSum + leftSum** is never returned by the function since we only return the value of a path going to **one subtree and not both**

* [Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/description/)
  - <a id="List_To_BST"></a>
  - **Needs REVIEW**
  - VVVVIIIIIPPPPPPP
  - its similar to the array but here if we have to get at first the mid point => the complexity will become O(n logn) so we can keep it O(n)?
  - so the solution is to:
    1.  We first count the number of nodes in the given Linked List. Let the count be n.
    2.  After counting nodes, we take left n/2 nodes and recursively construct the left subtree.
    3.  After left subtree is constructed, we allocate memory for root and link the left subtree with root.
    4.  Finally, we recursively construct the right subtree and link it with root.
  - The above algo doesn't need to have a pointer to the mid from the start it just need to know the index of the midpoint => O(n)
  - basically we are using InOrder traversal
  - [solution](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-linked-list-to-balanced-bst/)


- [Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-consecutive-sequence-binary-tree/)
  * do a preOrderTraversal
  * __TRICK:__ to decide the length at every node do: return Math.max(leftLength, rightLength, __currentLength__).
    -  we need to compare to currentLength since the children may reset the length since child.val != current.val + 1
  * [my solution](http://buttercola.blogspot.com/2015/12/blog-post.html)


- [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/)
  * Pay attention that the **condition holds if we are on a leaf node and the sum == 0** and not when reaching a null node 
  * since: 
    * if we have only a null node as a root we shouldnt return anything
    * if we may added the list twice (when reaching right child of leaf null and left child where both are null)

- [Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)
  - Question: find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST
  - If we are able to sort the elements => its easy to know the most occured
    - how? just by iterating over the sorted elements and counting the occurence of each element by saying (if num[i] == num[i - 1] => occ++ => check if we put in list)
  - In order to achieve this sorted order iteration we can do an inorder iterative Traversal
